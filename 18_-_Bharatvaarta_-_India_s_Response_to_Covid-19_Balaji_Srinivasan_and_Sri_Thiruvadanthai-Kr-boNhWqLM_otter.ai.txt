Unknown Speaker  0:11  
Namaste everyone, I'm Roshan cariappa. And welcome to another episode of the barakaatuh podcast. And we're living in exceptional times, we've been in a lockdown for over two months here in India. You've heard the government announced a stimulus package for businesses last week. And there's been as per last estimates, about hundred and 20,000 confirmed cases, and over 3000 deaths due to the corona virus. There's also been a lot of talk on what has happened and how we are reacting to it as a nation as a people, and how our governments have fared and in fact, we've done three episodes before on the impact of COVID-19. And the government's response. Today, we'll be doing a fourth that examines this response in further detail from a global lens, and really understand the impact of all of this going forward. So on the podcast today, I have two very special guests with me, both based in the US are one on the East Coast, and the other on the west coast, perhaps to give a more balanced view of things. We have Srinivasan theravadan tie, who is managing director and Director of Research at the levy forecasting center and aside from economics, which is his main expertise, Shree also has an interest in banking, technology and psychology. He's also been an active voice on social, economic and political matters. Concerning India. Welcome to the podcast, Shree, rare to have you. Thank you Roshan. Joining us in this conversation, we also have Balaji Srinivasan, who is an investor and entrepreneur. He founded a genomics company called counsel, which sold for about 370 $5 million, a couple of years back. He's also been an active voice on COVID, and was one of the first few people to pick up on how serious the whole thing was. Thank you so much for joining us. Balaji. Pleasure to have you as well.

Unknown Speaker  2:15  
Thanks for having me.

Unknown Speaker  2:18  
All right. So before we get started on India, specifically, I just wanted to ask the both of you, if you could name a single event or anecdote that got you to take COVID very seriously. Balaji, aside from the you know, hi, hi, are not numbers of the virus. You've said it was seeing how China behaved, quite contrary to its usual mercantilist ways, or any particular incident that you recall.

Unknown Speaker  2:46  
Yeah, I mean, you know, certainly the lockdown of Wu Han was, was was important, because that showed the level of expense and energy that China's putting into this, how seriously they were taking it. And, and seeing Not just that, but also the reports from people on the ground. Those were those were really the main events for me. And then I started digging into literature.

Unknown Speaker  3:10  
Right, right. Actually, when did you realize that, you know, we were in the middle of a life changing event.

Unknown Speaker  3:17  
But you know, I didn't, I can't say it's more evolved. But as Balaji said, you know, more belville civil knocking down, I was thinking, you know, a bill, I remember staff, and it didn't seem NIH one and one. And there were clearly no knock downs of this nation that it has told me to do, we're dealing with a different kind of animal here. But you know, as to, you know, I have my whole thing evolved. I can't say that there was a Jesus moment for me where I thought this was going to be very, this was going to be very serious. I, I kept evolving my thinking as a gift.

Unknown Speaker  3:55  
Right. Right. And, you know, continuing on that note, Sri, and then maybe Balaji, you could comment on this as well, just to set the context for the rest of our discussion. If we were to measure around four key areas, right, let's say response time to the crisis, ability to test an isolate, set up supporting healthcare infrastructure, and then, you know, provide economic and social relief, on balance. How would you say India has fared in its response to covid Balaji. Your thoughts?

Unknown Speaker  4:27  
Yeah. Can you repeat those four, again, it was a response to crisis relief, or though to

Unknown Speaker  4:31  
response time to the crisis. Second, would be ability to test and isolate, maybe set up supporting healthcare and healthcare infrastructure, and then provide economic and social relief. I mean, feel free to add an element or parameter if you think that's necessary.

Unknown Speaker  4:50  
Yeah. So my, my overall take is that India has punched above its a weight here. It's done better than I expected it to Do on actually kind of think it is a, you know, maybe I'm not sure if this is a left handed compliment or what have you. But it's among the best of the Western countries, but it's among the worst in Asia. And so what I mean by that is relative to the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, I think India does quite well, in terms of large scaled question, you know, align countries, relative to Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, you know, and so on, it does not do well. With that said, a relative to where I thought it was gonna land up on the things that have impressed me, you know, from as an NRI on about India, our first that, you know, they're in there, Modi, has taken it very seriously from the beginning. He never called it just the flu, he has been dignified on Twitter about this, this, this whole episode on he is, you know, talked about wearing masks, and has basically been on message about it. Other things India did, I think relatively early, they thought were good, they shut down travel, they actually made it hard even for, for Indian citizens to come back. That's great. Um, they have, you know, one of the most interesting things about India is with the recent things like other and UPI, and now rhodia, say, through which, you know, maybe, you know, mispronouncing that, but with the recent, sort of national software projects like this, there's bugs in them, I'm sure, you know, you can point to flaws. Still, it's actually execution beyond where, frankly, the US or UK or, you know, like, like the leading NATO countries have have been able to do there is no, erroneous athiya equivalent in the US, the closest equivalent for a large country is something like WeChat in China, where they have like a COVID-19 thing built into WeChat. And what are the yellow, green and red codes? So from like, a software and technology standpoint, I think India has actually done surprisingly well. I think so some messaging they've done well, so also the thing where their example of messaging, every phone call in India had that 32nd clip, right, which I posted on SoundCloud, and, you know, just stuff like that, where they were taking it seriously, from the beginning, they did the travel ban, they did the, you know, public health announcements, Modi, you know, got the significance of it across the dinner road, you see it through a lot of those things love the blocking and tackling feels like the country has actually taken it seriously and taken it seriously in a consistent fashion on now, you know, it's still in many ways a developing country, there's, there's pockets of you know, like, like wealth and not wealth, and so on, on on balance. So I think, you know, my prediction as to where it's going to land up, and I wouldn't say I have extremely high competence, but I think it's going to land up is that by the end, India will be considered more of appear to, you know, the US, UK, Italy, Spain, Germany, on and you're gonna see probably like a new security alliance with, you know, these relatively weaker NATO countries, and India versus potentially China and its allies. And I think that's kind of what's what's likely to happen, you know, towards the end of this opening.

Unknown Speaker  8:27  
Yeah, I think we don't have very different definitions of developing and developed world post this for sure. And be able to do it at the scale at which India operates, right. 2,000,000,004 sorry, 1.4 billion people. One of the things that you've mentioned Balaji before is that, you know, you would prefer a more decentralized response. And, you know, while our law and order has been decentralized, it's at the state level, our testing strategy or you know, things like lockdown design and so on, have been, you know, quite centralized. Right.

Unknown Speaker  9:01  
Hmm. Yeah. So, let me let me talk about that for a second. Um, I think I've been actually clear on this, which is that I think the best outcome is a competent centralized state, like a Singapore or South Korea, on because some services are just easier to, to perform centrally, or to execute, deliver. And then a distant second is a decentralized response where individuals, communities, companies take it upon themselves to, you know, fix Corona, or prevent it. And then even farther down is an incompetent or even malicious state. But let's say an incompetent state is worse than a decentralized response because for example, they can protect prevent people from rolling out new lab tests in the US, you know, the FDA has tried to prevent people from doing this. They have given Frong instructions to people like don't wear masks. You know, the CDC and Surgeon General said this kind of thing in the US. So The best is a competent centralized state. a backup plan is a decentralized response. And the worst is an incompetent centralized state. One other asterisk on that, typically, you know, in a, you know, well functioning society, it's not just the competent centralized state, but it's also a decentralized response that states the state and society, it's, you know, government going and doing a bunch of things, but then you as an individual taking personal responsibility and your company, you know, filtering for this, and so on. So they're not mutually exclusive. I would say that, you know, for things like a contagious virus, a lot of the, you know, libertarian ish paradigm breaks down, because

Unknown Speaker  10:39  
you have,

Unknown Speaker  10:42  
um, you know, live and let live, you have a very large stake in what your neighbor is doing health wise, what they're doing behavior wise, on because, you know, like, if they go and get a tattoo or something, it doesn't really affect you. But if they go and bring back COVID-19, it could affect you on and so, so a lot of these kinds of things sort of break down into sort of exceptional situation, which we may be in for quite a while, unfortunately.

Unknown Speaker  11:07  
Yeah, absolutely. I think a fair mix of you know, as you mentioned, Central and state measures, Sree on balance. So how do we rank around those four parameters or some new parameters that you can think of?

Unknown Speaker  11:21  
Let me start off with

Unknown Speaker  11:24  
validator copy to be the state

Unknown Speaker  11:28  
at this point, I mean, I think that's really the key issue here that you need. A very good state capacity is COVID really is testing us against all these dimensions, right? A capacity as well as the social capacity, the society's capacity to, to be empathetic, and to see the larger interests of society. Because if you take the mask itself, for instance, it is not so much by wearing the mask, you are preventing the infection coming to you, there is a self interest in that, and we will all do that. But actually the mask that's more important for not spreading infections from you to other people. So there is altruism in that. So you know, that is that clearly, that for these patients have done so much better, partly because there is a much greater social condition. But also there is a greater capacity built over decades. So the combination of that is why these patients have done so much better, compared with anybody else in the ranks middling simply because, you know, because it has the same level of state capacity. I mean, obviously, it's a poor country itself, much poorer country. But, you know, I've been quite struck by how much discipline average people have generally showed when I talk to people, you know, I own the average him some tremendous amount of discipline. So, coming back to your points, you know, the, the, the response from the government, I mean, to be honest, I felt when they first took this response and Marshall in an expedient about it was very draconian, but I have been wrong, I would say, because they turned out to be right, and they have taken the CSE right from the beginning, there is no doubt about that. Not much, much medical, sorry. And even before that, they are already shut down, international travel lead and things like that. So the in terms of the ability to test an isolate, obviously, India has not been that beta, although they've ramped it up. And that's the main problem. And that comes from the fact that you don't have adequate healthcare facilities to especially the testing perfect isolation, they were doing a decent job earlier, although they started getting overwhelmed to some extent, that again, you know, India, such a large country with 1.1 billion people showed restraint as to what to do to restrain endangered everybody and such population density and, and difficulty of maintaining social distance, all you need is a few bad actors or few, let's say candidate actors, I don't want to imputing you then you can get into trouble, right? I mean, that, you know, in doing reasonably well. And suddenly this, this this vegetable market encumbered and you know, since then it has been a bit awkward to try and control it. And in terms of healthcare support, you know, okay, you know, the we don't have adequate infrastructure, whether it's per capita doctor, per capita hospital beds, we just don't have that level of Well, that's just a reflection of the fact that you're a poor country, still, relatively speaking. Sure, we can make more investment in this and in going in the future, we should and we should be a wake up call. Where India has been the weakest I would say, is the economic response, and that unfortunately, is possibly causing the second round of problems in terms of the migrant workers. You know, I mean, you may be sorry, you're gonna say something?

Unknown Speaker  15:05  
No, no, I was just agreeing with you.

Unknown Speaker  15:08  
Yeah, so the economic response, I mean, you look at the US the scale of the fiscal support in the US, and the alacrity and the speed at which they roll these things out, or even the Federal Reserve, all of these were done. So quickly, in relation to the, to the physical efforts of controlling COVID, which never forced me to set that just and the dichotomy between those two things. And the contrast to juxtapose against India where they were much more showed much greater laxity in kicking the the physical measures to, to control COVID. But as they have been very cautious study, and even, you know, I slow in rolling out one measure after the other. And I was saying that India doesn't have the same resources and the capacity, I don't want to ever include that India can do what the US That said, it will have done much, much, much less than what he could have done.

Unknown Speaker  16:08  
Well, so hold on one second. So, you know, I don't think that the US is spending was, was good at all, in the sense of the $2 trillion bill, for example, it seems like a very small percentage of that was allocated towards vaccines, masks, you know, drugs, devices, like like ventilators, stuff like that, um, I think there was some for hospitals, but a lot of it was sort of treating the problem as if it was a political or economic problem fundamentally, rather than a biological or physical problem. Um, I think also, it is true that, you know, Digital Measures are easier to roll out, because, you know, that moves at the speed of the internet, which is, which can move faster than the virus and physical measures are harder. But, um, you know, I actually think that what the US did, in terms of printing trillions of dollars in a few weeks, is not something that other countries want to emulate. And it's actually, you know, like, good that the that India hasn't done something quite as extreme as that.

Unknown Speaker  17:09  
Okay, let me say two things. One is, half the economic measures been towards health care as much in the US No, clearly not. That is not the priority. I mean, at the end of the day, the US is, as Calvin Coolidge famously said, the business of America as best as you can see the dichotomy and the depth of the response to, to the the economic fallout, containing the economic fallout. So most of the US fiscal response, and the feds response has been to contain the damage on the business sector or financial markets, rather than in trying to, you know, spur greater health care spending or, you know, support the healthcare infrastructure.

Unknown Speaker  17:53  
But I argue,

Unknown Speaker  17:55  
here's why I argued that's wrong on even if you are focused on economic growth, you want to put out the viral fire first. So you know, essentially what the Fed has done, and what that $2 trillion bill was like, it's like, oh, we need to fix this person who's bleeding, let's get a bunch of mops, to mop up the blood on the floor, as opposed to bandaging the wound and you know, putting antibiotic or whatever on it on, if you allocated all of the monies to fixing the virus and stopping it from disrupting society, you'd actually have a better economic outcome in the medium to long run. And I think that's the short sighted thing is treating things symptomatically only going and you know, giving payroll support or what have you which looking emergency, you might have to do some of that. But the lion's share, the prioritization should have been unblocking, uh, you know, testing, for example, unblocking entrepreneurs, for example, making making it easy for people to build masks, not just to import them, but to raise the prices on them. So that to allow for prices to evolve, such that if people wanted to pay 10, or $20, for a mask, they could and then every factory in America would have been making these things. I think they they completely messed that up. Because a they didn't treat it didn't treat the root to treat the symptoms. And B, they didn't actually unleash the economy to allow to reallocate to go and defeat the virus.

Unknown Speaker  19:20  
Yeah, I think those are I don't have a disagreement. I mean, that's obviously goes to the deeper political economy point. The point here is, what are the restrictions on why we don't do these things? And, you know, letting for example, prices, to some extent dictate production. You know, again, there would be all that transparent gouging, you know, it's just the politics of the thing, whereas it's much easier to roll out a stimulus that everybody seemingly benefit from but but I do agree that I don't have a bias, a disagreement. All

Unknown Speaker  19:55  
right. And actually, though, just to talk about that point for a second, the issue is If you do things that are popular, but that aren't, like, aren't good in the long run versus doing the things that are good but unpopular, take that example. Um, the, the people's general objection to price gouging is, oh, in a time of vulnerability, somebody is exploiting me. And, you know, one can argue that point in, let's say, a hurricane or a one day event, you know, oh, why is this store jacking up the prices on me, I'm usually a good customer. Now they're trying to explain to me this a long run relationship I might pay today, but I don't like it tomorrow. That may be legitimate in terms of a one day event. But this is actually something which is like an economic reallocation, you know, we have we have talked about it on Twitter is, it's not a V shaped recovery or a W shaped recovery with bounces back and up, up and down, but rather a y shaped recovery, where the economy was on one branch. And now it's going to be taking another branch, many aspects of what I call the physical leisure economy in the US at least, bars, concerts, restaurants, events, things of this nature that involve large crowds, also, public train, and things like that, now have very high costs in operating in an environment with uncontrolled COVID-19. The reason being, they now have, for example, pandemic insurance, they have liability, if you're a restaurant, you need to space out your tables so that you have less revenue, since you can only have like one third or one half the number of patrons, every table needs to be cleaned, need to buy masks and hand sanitizer for all of your employees and on and on the list goes in terms of the tax that COVID-19 uncontrolled COVID-19 imposes on society. And so, you know, the, the thing is that the economy needs to react and allocate to be able to deal with that. And so the far thinking, you know, politician would take the short term pain of saying, Okay, I'm going to let prices rise on masks on tests on hand sanitizer, and all this stuff, such that, for example, alcohol manufacturers could turn around and start cranking a hand sanitizer on factories could turn around and start making masks, because if you can make windfall profits off of this, then you can actually put people back to work and help put out the viral fire. Because it's not a one day thing, it's not even a one month thing, it's like, probably not even a one year thing, this is a multi year thing. So so so far sighted leadership would actually allow prices to evolve, the way I put it is control the virus, not the prices allow the economy to reallocate and short sighted leadership, I would argue, is just again, treating it symptomatically doing things that are popular, but that don't actually solve the root problem. And frankly, it will be unpopular in the medium to long run because it insulted very eloquently.

Unknown Speaker  22:47  
I mean, I can't disagree. I mean, I think part of the problem arises from the fact of the US political dysfunction, which really tends to the archaic nature of the US political system, we are often proud of it here, we say, oh, check the census and all that stuff. But reality is, and Huntington wrote about this long path is that the US political system is actually pre modern one, all the models in western states, European states, in particular, from American European because Europe is fundamentally settled by Europeans. And you know, so if you think about it that way, they all have a different the capacity and state structure compared to the US and you know, so I mean, it's, it's a complex problem, and COVID really reflects that, that the dysfunction of the US political system. I can't disagree with you at all.

Unknown Speaker  23:39  
Yeah. And so actually, it's interesting, you know, I agree with much of what you said, I would I let me offer an asterisk or let's say, addendum, you know, whatever to the other half. So part I definitely agree with you on is that the US political system is, is dysfunctional. On the part that, you know, I'd offer an agenda or quibble, or what have you is that I don't necessarily think that other Western systems, like political systems are a model, like I wouldn't say, you know, France is better, Germany may have some better aspects in terms of their trade, schools and so on. But I actually think the real model for the West is going to be the West Coast. Because if you think about, like the, you know, with the and these are not exactly geographic entities, I'm using this as a mechanism, right. But what the East Coast of the United States has exploded over the last 2025 years has been financial crises and invasions and bombings and drone strikes. That's kind of what the rest of world has sort of experienced from the east coast of America. Whereas on the west coast, America has given Google and you know, iPhone, and on, you know, all of these internet technologies, startup culture, and the concept that anybody anywhere in the world, they're not going to be President of the United States of America unless they were born in the US and even then it's actually relatively difficult to do. Very difficult to do. But anybody anywhere can set up a tech company and become, you know, a tech millionaire or billionaire, you know, when we were putting that as there's only 45 US presidents, but there's, you know, been hundreds, thousands of billionaires, depending on how you count. And so it's actually a more achievable goal, a more realistic goal for many people, you know, a kid in India can become a tech billionaire not going to be president, the United States. And the thing about this also, is that these tech companies have functional organizations. One way of thinking about it is, you know, somebody who's the CEO of, you know, something like Google or Facebook has built something up from absolutely nothing to a gigantic multinational entity with billions of people depend on it. Whereas, for example, someone who's, you know, the mayor of New York, or the President has inherited an organization and they didn't just inherit it from the predecessor, they've inherited, you know, 3040 generations hence. So the mayor of New York, for example, would not be capable of assembling the NYPD from scratch, you know, of training them of figuring out what their uniform is going to be what their doctrine is going to be their rules of engagement, he has inherited that, and he's inherited that to such a level that he doesn't understand how it started in the first place. I think that's a very deep point that folks on you know, who are our true leaders have built something up from scratch, as opposed to inherited that to say, founding as opposed to election as kind of the mantle of legitimacy for a leader? Why Why are you a leader, because you're one of the founders, and the US used to have this with, you know, for example, the founding fathers, right. And then people, you know, would argue about whether this or that was emulating those founders, and eventually, it got so diluted, that anything could be said to emulate the founders.

Unknown Speaker  26:40  
So, go ahead. You can see that I mean, the response of the West Coast has been so much better compared with where I live here in New York, in New Jersey, having even though both tend to be in the middle America boots tend to be clubbed together, as you know, the by Coastal elites. But you know, I think that is a big difference between the west and east coast in in terms of our attitude, and I think there is a lot of the the old world Tammany Hall which continues to hobble the the the response, I mean, clearly, you can see that I mean,

Unknown Speaker  27:19  
that's right. And I think, you know, this is something which is interesting model for the medium to long term future is, um, I think, you know, what's interesting is India has has had a tradition of, you know, the IITs and you know, smart folks, individuals doing things. It's got like a guru culture and whatnot. And I think that actually will serve it well, in a softer age where one person can have a lot of leverage. You know, as I said, like, I think some of the biggest successes India's had, in recent years have been things like either UPI, or even with its issues, erroneous hit through, I think, on balance. I think that the reform of the Western political structure has to be I think, coming from from a Z axis, I don't think you can reform it within the structure. For example, Bitcoin, you know, which I think a lot about, obviously, is one of the most important political reforms ever. And it's a reform of the Federal Reserve. It's a reform of the banking system. It's a reform of the political system. It's a reform of, you know, frankly, debt culture, a lot of things. But it came from a Z axis, it came from the internet, it came from cryptography, it came from something that wasn't within the existing xy plane of what is considered to be politically feasible. And I think something similar is going to happen where over the next 10 years, have you guys played around with Oculus quest?

Unknown Speaker  28:46  
Oh, goodness VR to me.

Unknown Speaker  28:48  
Yeah, you should get an Oculus quest. If you have not gotten an Oculus quest. It's the most important device since the iPhone. And the reason I say that, you know, like, I was at Andreessen Horowitz when we did the Oculus investment a few months before it got acquired by Facebook back in 20 2013 2014. And it's developed a lot over the last six, seven years, the long term investment for sure, but essentially, is cross the chasm where virtual reality and connect the things in a second virtual reality is now quite immersive. You can tilt your head around, you can walk around in 3d, it'll, it'll actually move on. It's, it's it really feels like you're transported into another place. The headsets have gotten lighter, it's kind of cross that chasm. And it's like the iPhone one, you can see where the iPhone x is going to be, you know, like, eventually VR will probably get to a glasses form factor or something like that. Okay. What's my point? The point is that right now, on the internet on social media, when you have, you know, 2 million followers or 2000 people who like a tweet or what have you, people just see a number on screen. And they know it's kind of a big number or a small number, but it's a very different thing to perceive the same thing except in video. If you have 200,000 followers, or you know, 5 million followers, or 2000 people favorite tweet, that's like seeing in VR, a gigantic audience of people clapping. And crucially, all those people can see other people. One way of thinking about it is, people don't actually really understand how big the Internet has gotten. Because they don't see it in their peripheral vision, they don't see hundreds of millions of people on social networks milling around, they just, it's still experienced as a very solitary activity with you tapping on a phone or a laptop, or what have you. The point being, here's why, here's why I put these together, people are going to be able to start virtual countries, with their own governance systems, with smart contracts, and so on and so forth as the legal systems. And you're going to attract people there, and you're going to have commerce there. And yes, it's going to be digital commerce, it, you know, physical commerce will have to be obviously more difficult. But, um, I think you're going to start to see, you know, folks building up societies online, on that potentially have renderings of the physical world and then materializing them offline. And this is how you kind of address the problem of elites that have inherited a system that couldn't build it, the next step is to actually build I think virtual societies with their own hierarchies and legal systems, and have that be a model for the offline environment could be, and many of these will fail. By the way, many of these will be worse than the current system, just like many startups are worse than the current, you know, the status quo, but some of them will actually be very well organized with strong cultures, and then I think they'll materialize in the physical world. So I think that's, that's going to be the West Coast method for reforming you know, these political systems. Okay, go ahead. I know, there's a quite a download.

Unknown Speaker  31:48  
Oh, fascinating.

Unknown Speaker  31:50  
I'm not a visionary that you are

Unknown Speaker  31:55  
even more mundane, little fluffy, let me just say one thing, I think, you know, coming back to the how technology actually enhances the capacity and you know, how some of the old words what systems

Unknown Speaker  32:08  
act as, you know, kind of

Unknown Speaker  32:11  
inhibitors. So in in India to you know, if you see the the whole software boom, part of the reason why India was the software boom was able to take place, is that it was outside the radar of the general regulatory state that existed. And that's why particularly, to some extent, it's not that the general regulatory state was is a terrible thing. I mean, it's okay. I mean, I, I don't want to, like everybody, blame it too much. I mean, it's done okay, job or something, to set up for a particular thing for a particular purpose for being an administrative state that that tries to tackle emergencies and law and order that was the British model. And, you know, that's what the British cared about. And, you know, it did an okay job. But beyond that, it's obviously not capable of developing a country, what called a developmental stage known as capable of meeting the needs of this modern society. And so what has happened is, that's why you see these other has been able to bypass and circumvent some of the problems in state capacity, the Indian Embassy, and the economic taking place, along with the mobile revolution, which enabled us to, you know, bypass not having the state capacity to build landline, like, you know, when I was growing up, it used to take 10 years to get a landline in India. That's how my father made the request for a landline 10 years ago, in the 1970s, or whatever. And then the mobile revolution circumvented that, okay, that's the problem, but it's no longer a problem. And the same with with other, it's now it's a common thing, a lot of the lack of state capacity. For instance, not having a proper identity. Yes, we have a social security card, and the US doesn't have anything like that. So how do you do a credit check for somebody? How do you ensure that this is actually the person or actually helps you with that, so that's why others not on the FinTech revolution is enabled geo to build up very, very rapidly, which otherwise wouldn't have been possible. And now, you know, without obvious, okay, you can see how we are able to build state capacity, which is not really dependent on the existing state infrastructure. And, and yet, I mean, that, in that sense, the power of technology can feel much more than a place like India, even more than that in the US. And in fact, actually, Indians are much more embracing of it. I feel like a lot of older Americans are much more resistant to this than then. Then India.

Unknown Speaker  34:51  
Yeah, I think I'm

Unknown Speaker  34:53  
sorry. Yeah. So, you know, one thing I've thought a lot about is, um, over the last 500 years years, the rest of the world has had to, um, you know, like, like they've had to implement reforms at various times, for example, Japan with the Meiji Restoration, when European colonialists came and they were technologically, you know, head on China with Deng Xiaoping in 1978, Eastern Europe and, you know, like Russia to some extent, after the Cold War ended India in 1991, with one mon Singh. Um, you know, like, leaders outside the West have had the, you know, sort of humiliation, followed by recognition that they need to turn around society, and have actually executed on that, at the, at the political level, the West has actually not been behind in the way that I think it's currently behind in 500 something years. And so there isn't really a recognition that that's happened at the political level. However, again, at the level of the tech CEO, um, you know, for example, and people don't understand how big a deal this was. But, you know, in the 90s, when Bill Gates saw the internet coming, and turned around Microsoft to go and ship Internet Explorer, that was a massive shift for them, you know, from the desktop to the to the internet was massive, massive shift. Similarly, you know, Zuckerberg in 2012 2013, going and taking Facebook, from a desktop only company to a mobile company, enormous platform shift that, you know, it seems trivial today, but it's it was a huge change in all their thinking the entire app had to be re laid out to get figure out what things people will click on mobile versus desktop, it was a massive, massive undertaking against an existential threat. And, you know, third example, Netflix going and having, going from mailing DVDs built by other people to people, versus streaming first party content is an enormous business and technological and operational shift. So the I think one of the big issues is that the western political system, because it's like this inherited kind of thing, people don't don't remember what it was to get on top in the first place. They don't remember a time when the West was behind, they don't understand they don't have a language for that. Um, and whereas there's folks in other countries do, I think India has a recollection of poverty, and has a recollection of scarcity that's been within everybody's memory. So thinking about how Oh, things could get worse. It's not like a crazy thing. It's not a paranoid thing to say, whereas thought of as such, or dubbed as such, often in the West, because things have been so good for so long. Um, I think that's a big part of, you know, the issue here is kind of whether you call it exceptionalism or arrogance or complacency or what have you. I think that's why the West has not really done that well on this.

Unknown Speaker  37:48  
Yeah, I think I think that's a bad point, because they have not had the kind of a, you know, memory of a catastrophic is not that far away in India, or both places in the world. And here we clearly, you know, I mean, I remember Hurricane Sandy, when it was when it hit here, and we didn't have power for 11 days or something like that. I mean, and allow me people didn't have it for nine, seven days depends on the people getting rid of dealing with and, you know, the the response was actually pretty shoddy. Overall. That's why it drives down. I mean, it's pretty shoddy, for a developed country, you think that they will be able to do it much faster. But they were not. I mean, they were like deer caught in headlights for for some, some, some extent. And, you know, I mean, clearly, they didn't have the capacity to breed, but that's because people are the left field for that.

Unknown Speaker  38:44  
Yeah, you know, it's interesting, like, I like your phrase, a memory of catastrophe. Because, you know, extending that to COVID. You can think of that as a civilizational vaccination. You know, you you had something bad happened in the past, and now you've got some antibodies to this thing, and you can recognize it, pattern, match it and respond to it, so that, you know, bad things don't happen again. I think also, you know, with Hurricane Sandy, um, you know, Nassim Taleb, he has this concept of famous concept of the Black Swan, you know, but I think what's interesting is this concept of a black signet, you know, signet being a baby swan. And in retrospect, for example, before 911, you could see the, the World Trade Center bombing of 1983, the attacks on the USS Cole, there were there were black cygnets before the Black Swan in retrospect, you could make the dot sign up there were warnings the same way with the US, you know, the fact that, you know, anthrax or Ebola or Katrina or Hurricane Sandy, both, you know, biomedical disasters and physical disasters. The response was actually quite poor,

Unknown Speaker  39:50  
um,

Unknown Speaker  39:52  
should have, you know, those are black signals. So, those are warnings that actually the rot had gotten deeper than people think. But it was it It took a like a gigantic blow like this to make people realize, wow, okay. It's systemic. It's not just, you know, one city or one state on it is the entire political system. It's a media system. It's it's, it's it's really the whole whole whole shebang

Unknown Speaker  40:17  
right. Oh, no, absolutely. I mean, that is yes. And you're right. I mean, that's actually a good point. We have had many of these, and our response has been very inadequate. But we somehow have not learned from that. Katrina was a complete disaster. That was Sandy and kind of, we never really learned from them to be just went about this again, back to people as if this was like one of events and not adverse warning signals. And somebody. Yeah, it's a tragic, what can you say? I mean? Yeah, I mean, I think it's immediate, that actually an order if it is done cognitively, well, it could have the metals and certainly an economy thinks of it. This is what's in the UFC called Monday morning quarterbacking. One of the things that he could have done, I feel right now, in hindsight, I did not know this at the time, they could have done deep training with the migrants

Unknown Speaker  41:15  
in the beginning,

Unknown Speaker  41:17  
and whatever, quarantines they might have had to do with their respective places destination, they could have done that. So then it would have been easier to bring them back now. Now, those people are scarred, and they're going to be worried and not very reluctant to come back to the places of work. So which might make the economic restart a little bit tougher? But, you know, there's no way I could have I visualized this at that point. And, you know, I, maybe some other people did. But you know, that's, that's the one thing I can think of right now, that they could have done to Richard a little bit better. But they overall, they have not done a terrible job. I mean, you know, it's reflects the the limits on the financial resources, physical resources, as well as an incredibly dense country where social distancing is hard. And what are the limits of what you can achieve? You know, I think we need to be realistic about that.

Unknown Speaker  42:18  
Yeah. Just to pick up on his point as well, right. Even our institutions are, you know, compared to the who, even the FDA that you know, biology has dealt with earlier, and have been found lacking in response, right. Our institutions, like the Indian Council for medical research, or the National Institute of virology, and so on, have been very proactive, whether in sharing data or ramping up tests. I think they're upwards of 100 k tests at this point of time, and on communication and so on, right?

Unknown Speaker  42:50  
Yeah, yeah. I said, you know, Indian doctors have done, you know, enormous, enormously difficult job, given the challenges, because we don't have the number of doctors per person, India's incredibly low. Hence, the number of hospital bed nurses, everything is very low. So, I mean, it's an if a curious

Unknown Speaker  43:14  
thing, but I do want to ask you about, you know, instead these institutions as well, because I mean, you've famously dealt with the FDA, right, and you've criticized them, as you know, sort of being inhibitors off innovation and not acting soon enough in the face of this crisis as well. We spoke about digital societies and, you know, innovation on that front? Or is this also an opportunity for us to kind of relook the way these organizations are structured and run, because at this point of time, I think they're structured to prevent harm, rather than foster innovation or cure.

Unknown Speaker  43:46  
Yeah, and I think it's important when talking about something like this to talk about it in terms of like thesis, antithesis, synthesis. So this is, you know, the, like, people want safe devices and drugs and whatnot, like people actually do want that, antithesis. Um, this regulatory system is actually more slowing things down and actually making people less safe. Because it's giving too many false false negatives. It's saying, Hey, I'm rejecting this, even though it's good. And I think the synthesis is say, okay, it's not that we need no regulatory system, we need a better regulatory system. We need, we need to, you know, yes, like, remove or give options to the existing one. But we can't just tear it down and have no replacement. And I think that the short answer for how to achieve that sort of like, you know, for example, you may think the Federal Reserve is abusing its power. But to simply remove the US dollar, you couldn't do that and said, you introduced Bitcoin, which is a very creative way of coming at the problem from a Z axis, where you introduce an alternative and allow it to build up over, you know, years and frankly, decades and it's gaining steam and gaining power, but it's It's not like an overnight replacement of the thing that's at the center of the existing financial system, you know, namely the dollar in the Federal Reserve. In the same way. For something like the FDA or any other major regulatory institution, the key is to think about how to build an alternative to it to focus your political capital, you're thinking, not on abolish, but on alternative. And how would that work, for example, in the US on on the FDA, you would have, for example, on there's alternate pathways outside the FDA, you know, doctors, for example, can do oil prescription laboratories can get regulated at the state level, rather than the federal level with something like CLIA. Pharmacists can do so called compounding pharmacy, things where they're basically prescribing combination pharmaceuticals without direct FDA approval. And, you know, of the combined drug. And so there's pathways outside the FDA already, but when the most powerful is the so called right to try pathway where, in some cases, at the state level, people can prescribe a drug for emergency use on by just notifying the FDA, not actually getting their approval to do it. And I think that this could be systematized where you could have, you know, states, these new interstate compacts that are arising in the US very under covered but very important, interstate compacts, meaning sub national entities, California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada are part of like, for example, the western states compact. You know, the Minnesota and other other states are part of the Midwestern compact. And these compacts could have regulation within their borders. For example, the Mayo Clinic could be working with the state of Minnesota and its other states to go and review drugs and devices, or in the western states compact, you could have Stanford and Berkeley, UCSF, UW and whatnot, working with California and Washington in order to review drugs and devices, because actually, the academics at these institutions are qualified to do that to diligence to do peer review of other people's technical work. And in fact, the FDA currently goes and subcontracts out with these folks through these this mechanism of expert panels. Right. And, and so I think that's a model where you don't abolish the FDA, it still exists. But you set up more formal alternatives for the right to try at the state level. Right. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  47:26  
So I want to talk a little bit about trade. As such, you know, we did an earlier podcast as well, on the end of globalization as we know it. And we also do a follow up on some of the labor reforms that have been announced. Sree, it seems like some of the states have stepped forward to kind of make it an easier for industries to set up and also hire people. a broader question is, you know, what can India do to kind of convert this crisis into an opportunity?

Unknown Speaker  47:54  
Yeah, I mean, if you look at India, development, through the, since independence, a lot of ways as you know, the economist can come in the generation Could I wrote a book called accidental India. So a lot of these things happen by accident, right? Because they will not by design, these things happen because people took something's happened, this was a crisis that force you to take certain actions. And that resulted in resulted in unexpected, you know, the downstream benefits over a long period of time, right. So, like the 1991 example, which everybody remembers, but there are many other things that you can go back and look in the past. Right. So for the 19th segment, then Lyndon Johnson forced India on a ship tomorrow, that poses on the on the Green Revolution, effectively, right? So because we want to be free of the leveraging controlled by foreigners. So, as we did this before, this is also an opportunity to get outside some of the the stultifying labor, labor laws that we had. I don't think it is a panacea, because I don't think the labor laws alone with the deal inhibitors of of investment in India, but it certainly helps because one of one of the things that they enable us to do is they prevent businesses from reaching their optimum scale and capacity X number one, because of all the, you know, small scale and limits on everything. So in certainly, they are good. And more important is you need to clear out a lot of inspectors, inspections and lot of approvals that you need to start a business and then you have to pay off so many people, and I think they have also done that Madhya Pradesh has taken some of those steps. It's not just about the labor, but overall he's getting an approval and starting a business. And I think that that's very critical, critical role of being a businessman. Ultimately, as the facilitator rather than as somebody who's, you know, who's gouging of society that that I think is, it's a step in that direction, I think I think it's a good, good thing. I mean, insofar as trade is concerned, you know, I think likely to move, but we haven't very careful and realistic, you know, for many of these things, manufacturing capabilities, for many things just do not exist in India. So the ecosystem building on this ecosystem will take years, it's not something that can be done overnight. And China has been doing this for many, many years, you know, they have the whole ecosystem out there. And it's not as easy to do it. So, you know, people will tell you about Vietnam and Bangladesh, but they're doing fairly low, low end stuff, which every developing country starts with textiles, and they are doing some electronic stuff, but you know, unreligious, mostly textiles. And this, we should probably be doing that too. But, you know, let's remember must have this advantage in textile comes from the fact that you are exploiting your labor in fairly brutal conditions, which wouldn't fly in India with a regardless of the labor laws, if you want to do that in India, it just would not, there is so much free press. And there is so much vigilance on civil society, that that kind of thing thing would not, would not be possible in India. So we have to be, we have to be realistic about what we are going to be able to get, and how long it will take. I think these are all the ingredients are there. And we are laying the foundations, and I'm optimistic. But you also should be aware of what can be done and just say, oh, Bangladesh is doing this and getting on this doing this. I think we should be careful about that. So yeah,

Unknown Speaker  51:44  
Balaji, I want to be mindful of your time, I know you have to need a word of asking a question around remote work. And, you know, virtualization that you mentioned earlier, as well, do you see more software and RND work coming out of coming to India, because technically, let's say if you can move out of San Francisco, you could also move out of the USA,

Unknown Speaker  52:03  
yes, I mean, the remote only or remote first will be it'll certainly be good for India, but it'll be good for every place that has, um, you know, it'll be good for poor rural areas in the US, it'll be good for any place that has talent on where, you know, it's, it's not in the Big Blue cities of the US, it'll probably be least good for the big blue cities of the US, it'll be best for pretty much everywhere else.

Unknown Speaker  52:30  
So and I think the reason for that is, you know,

Unknown Speaker  52:35  
if you've got an internet connection, you can now parachute in income rule of law, like a virtual community, and you can just kind of go and get a job there. And anything that's information work you can do there. And you might say, Well, okay, only that's only design or, or programming or legal work, or maybe medicine via telemedicine and say, Well, yeah, except we're also getting tele operation. Now, you know, remote control of drones is just the beginning. There's teleoperated, sidewalk robots for delivery. There's tele operated machines for supervising factories, I think we're gonna see many, many more, you know, aspects of the professional world being put into remote capable, such that you can operate them over an internet connection. And then what that means is, then you can operate them not just from down the street, but from anywhere in the world. So I do think that's kind of the direction of the 2020s.

Unknown Speaker  53:27  
Sure. So, you know, when they're nearing the end of the podcast, and a question that I want to ask the both of you is, you know, how do you see the exit playing out of here? Right. Know, some understanding on what the timelines would be, and so on about it, we can start with you. Sure, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  53:43  
So very briefly, I think, I thought there's a good summary of this, I tweeted a while back, but, you know, a vaccine, a drug or, quote, herd immunity are three ways to get out of this. And the thing is that they're not none of them are actually guaranteed. For example, with herd immunity, we have to know that immunity is long lasting, to COVID-19. And it doesn't, you know, dissipate, or a mutant version of COVID-19 doesn't come back every year or two years. The flu is known to be hyper mutable in certain ways. And so that's why you do need a flu booster shot each year, we don't really know COVID-19 is new. So we don't know how mutable it's actually going to turn out to be whether new strains will arise. So herd immunity is not a guarantee. A vaccine isn't a guarantee either we've got you know, I believe vaccines for animal coronaviruses but not not for humans yet on their hand. It's also something that the entire world is working on. So you know, you should you should think, Okay, well, probably someone will figure it out. But it's not 100% and then a drug also you'd have to have that drug or treatment more generally take morbidity down and mortality down quite a lot for it to be feasible. Um, so the timeline, any of those i think is uncertain. And so there's one scenario where we we get one of those things quickly. Another scenario is where we get one of those things slowly. And a third scenario is we get one of these things, never or not for a very long time. And it just becomes an endemic disease that humans have to live with, like, polio was for a long time, like, you know, other conditions were. And I think that's likely actually, on I don't, I don't read it 99%. But don't read it 1% either. And in which case, we have to figure out how to, like, modify society to deal with that it may mean less folks living in cities, it may mean more rural activity, it may mean much more energy on biomedicine. I think that's the most optimistic route, which is we might have to pull the biomedical technologies of 2015 or 2100, into the present, self COVID-19. It's possibility. So that's kind of how I think about how this ends. And I think that the technological solution is probably probably the best, of course, it's my disposition. But I think we'll get knock on benefits from that if we pull future biomedical technology into the present day, in the same way that for example, you know, during World War One or World War Two, technology advanced 50 years and five years, you know, depending on how you count. If we do that here against this in this world war virus, we will we will have something which benefits us on the other side, you know, our biomedicines improved?

Unknown Speaker  56:17  
Yeah, I know, in many ways, I think COVID has acted as a forcing function for a lot of these trends that are already in play. And, you know, hopefully we get better health care better everything right out of this. Not just healthcare, I mean, better education. We're seeing attacks do really well, in India, for example. Right. So, yeah, Sri, how do you see this panning out from an economic perspective?

Unknown Speaker  56:41  
So, you know, I think here is what's what could happen if we do not get a cure relatively quickly? I think people will go back to as you said, I agree with him. You know, in the days before vaccines existed, it didn't it's not a key to shut down their lives, right. I mean, they just went about their lives, you know, they just live with the fact that, you know, there is a greater chance of contracting a disease or dying like measles, measles vaccine was in 1960s, in the US, and India didn't come out in the 1780s. So people, it's not like people shut down their lives. And so I think people will go back, but it will also restructure the way we do things. To the extent it is possible in India, it's harder because of the density of population. But here certainly, I think there will be d urbanization at thanks to COVID. But so the impact, I feel like one is the hollowing out of the thesis is certain certainly stripe will start to happen. And the The other thing that I feel like a lot of the work that can be done remotely, I think this is a great opportunity for for India. And, you know, it's another leg in the BPO kto. For example, you were talking about working from home, my mike my classmates, Peter vembu, who is the founder of Zoho, you know, he

Unknown Speaker  58:09  
set up in a remote place and in

Unknown Speaker  58:13  
so much lower right, I mean, you can you can do this,

Unknown Speaker  58:17  
this stuff so much more easily now. And as you said, you know, COVID has been a catalyst, or certainly in the case, when already the transfer there, it's accelerated them, but for where the trends would not have been here, ingredients were in place, it's been a major accelerator, a major catalyst for making that shift. And so I think it could be hugely disruptive, because but you know, as with all disruptions, you're going to have tremendous investment opportunities. When juxtaposed against tremendous decline in in existing ways of doing business, as commercial, real estate, commercial property, you know, office space, and things like that. But again, not tremendous boom, in so many ways, we re engineer our life and our businesses. So yeah, I'm optimistic about that. Right?

Unknown Speaker  59:12  
So if you want to envision like sort of a new normal coming out of this, right, what is your one wish for India in that sense?

Unknown Speaker  59:21  
Ah, one wish for India is that hopefully this actually gets rid of the condition that we have in cities. So people don't live in a place like Mumbai origin, or wherever it is. It's horrible. If I can live in my village and work remotely, and enjoy the physical surroundings. Why not?

Unknown Speaker  59:41  
Yeah. So we had Sridhar vembu on a previous podcast of ours, and he was talking out of 10 Cassie in Tamil Nadu and you know, we could we could hear birds chirping in the background as well. Yeah. So this is a fantastic note to end the podcast on. Thank you so much. archery thank you Balaji for your time, fascinating conversation and you know, there were so many things to unpack here and hopefully we can do a follow up very soon in the future. So thanks everyone for tuning in. This podcast will be live on all popular platforms. do listen, subscribe and share with your friends and family. Until next time, stay safe and Jen
