Unknown Speaker  0:55  
Right everybody welcome to another episode of This Week in Startups. We're recording this on April 2. And it's important that I say that because every day is blending into the next and I'm losing track of what day of the week it is where I am and how long this coronavirus outbreak pandemic is going to continue on. And early on. I was able to track this in January and February, thanks to one of my followers and a friend of the show Balaji Sri now wasin Sreenivasan Balaji Srinivasan I think I got it right there is, and formerly I knew him because he was working at Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz, he's an angel investor, he was on the pod back on episode 769. A lot of you love that back in October of 2017. And he's, you know, one of these smart investors, science folks on the Twitter. And he was taking this very seriously talking about it, and giving us some warning. And many of us who are watching on social media, specifically the Twitter, we're watching these videos going, this seems pretty scary what's going on and move on. This does not seem normal. And Balaji was telling us it was not normal. And I saw a tweet, I'll pull it up here real quick. And it was this experience that I've had with what I call late stage journalist or late stage journalism. In other words, the end game of journalism kind of feels like we're in the final ending of journalism and something new will come out of this. But a journalist had dm Tim slid into the DMS, which journalists do and it's kind of just absolutely annoying when you're a person of note, who gets quoted by the journalist to have every story seemed to be spun or like you're being set up, or like the context is going to be missing where they're doing a hit piece, or they're doing something that is just off the mark, and you want to try to help that journalist. And so we got this email here. Hey, I am schriever in Jaffrey, and I'm reporter for recode we're doing a story about concerns about Coronavirus and Silicon Valley, the bay area we saw your tweets on the topic, would you be available to chat more about this on every phone call, please let me know. Right on his deadline. You can reach here and I'll just slide up. And Balaji says hey, you're not covering technologies to Chinese you're using to fight the virus hardware implications of supply chain disruptions. What biotech is doing in terms of antibiotics, vaccines, which you are covering is covering your tweets, right. I'm just going to ask you straight up when you got that tweet from the recode reporter. You kind of got that intuition. Welcome back to the pod by the way. Thanks for coming on. I know you're busy. I guess it's a kind of a laugh, right. I know you're busy, but I'm more busy now than I've ever been. I with so many companies in trouble. But when you got that first of all, are you doing okay, families? Okay, friends, okay.

Unknown Speaker  3:52  
Yes. Fortunately,

Unknown Speaker  3:53  
like, I feel like we have to ask each other. We're talking before the show that when he mentioned when we ask each other how are you doing? We actually like really care to hear the answer now.

Unknown Speaker  4:03  
Yep, that's right. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  4:05  
So

Unknown Speaker  4:07  
two questions to start us off here. Number one, what teed you off to this being such an important issue. How did you get on? It's so early in January? And then number two, when you got that? When you got that dm from the record reporter What? What gave you that? What was your reaction to it?

Unknown Speaker  4:28  
Yeah, so I mean, my background, I'm a, I'm a molecular diagnostics guy before I got into crypto, um, I think a lot of people didn't know that actually. Because I hadn't been on Twitter while I was doing that. But that's actually my formal training is in, you know, biology, genomics, genetic circuits, Bioinformatics, etc. And I taught that at Stanford and also, you know, founded a company based on that sold a company based on that for 375, on on diagnostics. So all the stuff that's out Now with the FDA blocking tests and, and so on, that's an area that I have some some background in, you know, I've actually like innovated, you know, so to speak in that area. So, so I had some disciplinary expertise to bring to bear on. And, you know, it was basically around the time that the lockdown of boo Han was announced on January 23, is when, you know, I'd sort of seen the virus in my peripheral vision, then among, you know, thousand other stories that you kind of read about or track. But the lockdown on June 23, was an unshakable signal that this was incredibly serious on, because that was an unprecedented event. You know, China's legitimacy, the state's legitimacy rests on, on delivering economic growth for its citizens, even if it doesn't have a political say, and for it to sacrifice economic growth or something meant that this was an extraordinarily Yeah, exactly. That's right. Um, so knowing you didn't, you didn't have to be like a rocket scientist, you know, to realize, Oh, my God, you know, that's these, these are not, they're not stupid people, right? Like the, you know, the Chinese government has engineers and they're, you know, people that there's a lot of things you can say about what they did, we'll talk about that with the censorship and so on, but they're not like, dumb and self destructive. And, or at least not not in this way. Yeah. So that's, that's what kind of like flag Oh, my God, this is actually really serious. Then dug into the papers and started reading these papers. And, you know, they're, they're like horror stories. They're written in like the inverse of clickbait. Right, you know, so, you hear about, you know, an A, like, you hear about a patient and they've got a compassionate use, you know, prescription and Oh, they had bilateral pneumonia. And basically, what they're actually saying is, okay, this healthy 35 year old, for example, the first case in the US was knocked to the ground by this illness had basically no pre existing conditions, was brought to death's door, and had to be saved by an experimental drug. You know, that's a real headline that's not written like that in an academic journal. So that's what got me concerned, then what's your second question? Please your mind.

Unknown Speaker  7:11  
Oh, and you get this dm from a journalist. And this is where I think the journalist kind of, I don't know, trivializing the issue, or maybe not understanding the severity of it. I think actually, when you look back on it historically, was a really good moment for everybody because it led to you then when the story came out, and it was in fact, a link baiting story that kind of missed the point of this and the severity of it. You then did a tweet storm where you said incredible last week, I called out a journalist who I thought was writing a piece that would be a disservice to public health, very measured language, by the way, but fortunately, my concerns proved well founded recode virus piece ignores who and CDC gets the science wrong and focuses on handshakes. Here's a thread and you went through it and just took the piece apart, bullet point by bullet point that has now 1300 retweets and 10,000 Plus I think, likes and I'm curious as to your thoughts on the journalist motivations. And then of course, after you did this sort of blow by blow taking apart why the story was wrong, I'm sure they did an incredible retraction and a Mia Copa and explain to you exactly what they would do differently the next time. So take me through, you know, how they are the outreach and how they made up for these engrave errors and your thoughts when you first saw the piece?

Unknown Speaker  8:35  
Yeah, so the outreach came on, like February 7, and by the way, you know, this story is just, it's just symbolic, it's representative, I, you know, there's, there's hundreds of other stories that were like this ever written at that time. And then probably, I don't know, thousands 10s of thousands of you and I have seen over the course of our careers that are like this, but this one, just, it just sticks out for a few different reasons. Because on February 7, died, basically now being kind of tweeting full time about the virus for like the last two weeks on because China was at war. It was it was, you know, using drone delivery, it was you know, doing thermal scans, it was having telemedical hospitals, it was basically throwing the full weight of the centralized Chinese state against this, with every technology and policy that they could bring to bear. It was like a stunning kind of series of events. And, and the videos that we're getting out on social media, you know, from a fairly censored Chinese environment where of, you know, basically sci fi movie scenarios, people being welded in their homes, you know, people like bodybags in on chairs and hospitals on you know, crazy crazy kind of events, people dropping dead in the street. So, so this was like this absolute, you know, like, insane thing that was happening overseas. And there are a number of implications of this. Well There could be shortages in the US there, you know, there could be technologies where we could learn from the Chinese in terms of, you know, what they're doing. Um, you know, there's that we could interview Chinese people and and, and see what's happening here in case this comes to our borders. Um, and so but what happened was on February 7, I got this outreach message. And I could tell immediately, that just the way it was phrased See, normally, you know, as you're aware, and maybe not all of your audiences, but the story behind the story is more important than the story typically. And what corporate journalists do, and I'll come to the distinction in corporate journalist and citizen journalists, they will employ a technique, which is called befriended betray. And so they'll send a seemingly polite message often when that butters you up, and that flatters your preconceptions as they see them talking about, you know, Oh, you were ahead of this, or Oh, you know, you're an important person to talk to etc. And then when the actual article comes out, your knifed. And then you're like, Well, that wasn't what we talked about at all, they just use one or two quotes from a 30 minute interview on and then they pull them out of context and use them to say what, whatever they intentionally originally intended to say. And so this one was actually a more on to a layman. Looking at this, somebody who hadn't actually dealt with corporate journalists before, um, it seemed like a polite outreach. But the key there is, I'm talking about concerns in Silicon Valley about this. Okay, right. And the further context,

Unknown Speaker  11:32  
right, was a little tip off. It's like, yeah, concerns in Silicon Valley, like, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:38  
that's right, because so the further context, you kind of need the secret decoder ring to be able to figure this out. Um, the further context was a recode, runs a lot of negative pieces about tech. It's basically like a gossip column that that masquerades as tech journalism, you don't you don't read about, you know, the latest Bluetooth or, you know, on post GIS releases or anything like that. It's not actually like a tech outlet in the sense of being savvy about technology. It's a gossip column, because it only talks about the personalities of people, oh, my God, how rich they are all this type of stuff. Um, that's it, that's one that's the outlet. And then two is the, the Friends of this person, or he shouldn't say friends, let's say the social network of this person, for example, former Rico journalists like, like Mike Isaac, or, you know, Teddy schleifer, you know, folks like that were very negative towards the idea that the virus was anything to pay attention to, um, you know, some of them were, you know, saying, Oh, you know, like, like, for example, Dan, I get his name wrong, but super magotteaux on Twitter, I think Dan Murphy, or I forget his last name. Um, but he had been talking about supply chain, you know, issues related to this, and was called a racist for his troubles, which, of course, those supply chain issues are causing drug shortages now, right. Um, and so, so the second context was just like journalists on Twitter, tech journalists, in particular, were very contemptuous towards this. And like,

Unknown Speaker  13:12  
recently, it's been very class warfare, VCs out of touch VCs, narcissists. And you know, it's a serious topic. And so you kind of get that sense that you're about to be nice. When we get back from this quick break. I want to talk about the role of citizen journalists in this and then, right when you saw the story, what your response was, we get back on This Week in Startups.

You know, when it was an interesting Horowitz, angel investor, you can follow him on the Twitter be a la JIS if you want to get really smart, really fast. So you know that this thing is going to be possibly, you know, you're gonna get shanked by this story. And they're going to make it about handshakes in Silicon Valley, and how VCs are weird and don't want to shake hands. Right? story comes out? Did you wind up talking to the journalist? You just passed?

Unknown Speaker  15:48  
No, no. And the thing is, the the journalists themselves, basically is acting on effectively cultural orders from the you know, both both recode and Kara and Vox more generally. And then, you know, the the journalistic is the tech journalism establishment. So I didn't, I didn't engage what I did was I basically called out the tweet. Yeah, I mean, cuz here's the thing, by the way, as again, I'm not sure your audience knows this. If you talk to a journalist under any circumstances, it's like talking to the police. Anything you say, can and will be held against you.

Unknown Speaker  16:20  
Right, not only can and will, will, I think, just take the kid out of it. It's just Well, that's, that's right. That's really how it feels. subject.

Unknown Speaker  16:27  
Yeah. That's right. So here's the thing, though, um, you and I are citizens, not subjects. Right. Right. You know, the folks who are at these media companies, and they there aren't the police, you know, there wasn't there's no license that they have, they don't have JDs or MDS, there's no government granted thing. They also don't have usually technical expertise. I'm there, their, you know, their sense of, oh, we're here to hold you accountable. And so I'm, I never signed up for that. And I and I frankly, don't Don't, don't bend the knee or whatever to to these folks. Because I think of them as employees of another Corporation, namely immediate Corporation, right? immediate corporation that is often a direct competitor of tech companies, for advertisers and influence. And so once you see them as just employees of another Corporation, well, you know, Google isn't giving interviews to, you know, a random person from Microsoft, you know, anytime soon, right? Tell me tell me about everything you're doing? Well, no, thanks. You know, um, and, and if, you know, Coke, went and attack Pepsi on their blog, people would immediately be able to see through it that well, okay, you're a competitor in the marketplace. Um, for some reason, and I think it's going to become it is becoming more obvious. Um, none of the media outlets disclose their rampant conflict of interest, which is that they're selling ads, to, you know, they're competing for, for example, for Rolex ads, or, you know, Mercedes ads in New York Times runs all those kinds of ads. Okay, with Facebook. Right. Um, and, you know, so they're competing on the back end, but even more importantly, they're competing on the front end for average for influence, right. For, for timers for for time, right. Attention. Yeah. And, and you know, Jill Abramson acknowledges this in her book, merchants of truths, former editor of the New York Times, she talks about how business imperatives help shape editorial judgment. A lot of journalists will deny this, they'll say, Oh, we there's a wall between advertiser firewall, the Chinese wall. Yeah, yeah, that's right now, by the way, that that exists, or at least existed for a long time at Google and Facebook, and so on, as well. There was a wall between the product side and the ad side, where one wasn't meant to influence the other. I'm not sure if that's still present, but it was for a while. But the thing is, it's a somewhat of a disingenuous answer. Because while you know, reporters may not be out there pitching ads, and they may not be conscious of all the backend stuff. They're certainly conscious of the fact that, you know, there's layoffs in the media industry, and that it's females in general, with some exceptions, like NYT subscribers. It's on a kind of a secular downslope on and so they're very resentful and negative on on that dimension. And that, I think, colors, a lot of it. So it's like a declining industry for many folks, or at least they feel like it. And then Oh, these tech guys, you know, or whatever. They're the agents were essentially to blame for the decline of media. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:19  
it's not that wrong. I mean, if you, yeah, they're not wrong. Crash rate gutted the classified business, the idea that you would advertise in the New York Times Wall Street Journal, a recode, over Facebook, or Twitter or Google, which would be much more effective, you know, in general, doesn't mean you don't advertise these other ones. But, you know, it's, these other networks have far more reach. And they have better tools. So they are they have been decimated by the tech industry. They're advertised that's right options, businesses.

Unknown Speaker  19:52  
That's right. And so basically what they can't win in the market, they want to win in terms of PR and so You know, like, I basically kind of bucket into three areas like 1995 to 2012 is sort of like the honeymoon period where, um, you know, for the most part tech, and, you know, journalism did did fine together. Um, and then after Obama's re election, the sharp disjunction, if you go back to December 2012, there were still positive stories being written about how tech helped Obama get reelected, and so on, if you remember that, like, of course, and

Unknown Speaker  20:28  
Right, yeah. And there was an optimism about tech in the world. That's right, massive optimism in that first era and a lot of optimism in the second.

Unknown Speaker  20:38  
Well, right, so then, so I think from 2013 to 2019, it was 2013. It's like a switch flipped, where there's different mental models of it, you know, how some people, for example, did World War Two all the way back to like the invasion of Manchuria rather than the invasion of Poland or whatever, you know, you can date the tech lash, arguably back to the death of Steve Jobs on because I think that he would have rather acquire the New York Times and let this AI economy series of articles come out, which was Oh, Foxconn people are jumping off buildings and so on, it didn't necessarily put the suicide rate into the background of, you know, what the overall Chinese suicide rate was. But that was like one of the first big negative stories and I think that was in 2012. But as before, everything turn negative between 30 and call that like a precursor to the tech lash. And so in 2013, there was like a switch flipped. And you started to get on, essentially, folks in East Coast media, realizing that they could get clicks by attacking tech, number one. And number two, I think at a broader macro level, you know, there were kind of four power centers on you know, on the coasts, so there's, you know, Boston, which has academia and you had la with Hollywood, and you had a, you know, you have New York with finance and advertising and media, and you had DC, which is the seat of government, and tech in San Francisco, and Silicon Valley, was just another partner to those four, until by about 2013, when, after Obama's re election, you know, Texas, a member of the Democratic coalition, on people in these other groups, especially, you know, the press realized, wait a second, tech isn't, like accepting its role as a junior partner anymore, it's coming for all the marbles, it is disrupting Hollywood, right? And it's disrupting academia with with MOOCs and so on. And it's, uh, it's, you know, not obeying all the regulations with Uber and stripe, and, you know, PayPal, and, you know, it's, it's also obviously going after media and basically was a delayed reaction to kind of the 2009 to 2012 financial environment, where tech was just eating so much, right. And so basically, post 2013, it was okay, you know, the backlash to technology taking all this territory. And folks who couldn't win in the market would try to win the PR war by attacking the reputations of tech people and tech companies, and so on. And again, like, I think of this as literally, Coke versus Pepsi, because I don't think of them as having any moral high ground. Um, it's basically old money versus new money. And, you

Unknown Speaker  23:12  
know, in fairness to them, I think, you know, the, the original goal of journalism was to, you know, find the truth and a lot of people who joined and signed up for it. I know I did when I was in the 90s. And I was actually a journalist and had publication, silicon reporter back in the day, you know, we were really trying to get to the truth, but we didn't have to contend with. We had a viable business. And so your business was viable, you really weren't struggling. And so you had this great, you know, you had advertising the guys in the in the gals would sell everything, you'd be fine. And then you could have a really good church and state, and then when the advertising got bad, and went away, and, and all that, and the resources went away. You had to file too often, you know, and yet, you didn't have fact checking, and you were just so resource constrained, you couldn't actually put the quality product on the table. You want it. So not, it's almost like not only were you in a battle with the tech industry, but you're under resourced. Right? Yeah. You're like in surgeons, you don't really have the same firepower, you know, that. It's not like the New York Times has the money or the power of the influence, to even do a lot of this journalism the way they used to. And so yeah,

Unknown Speaker  24:20  
one could say, one could say Necessity is the mother of hostility. Or Necessity is the mother of defamation, basically. Because exactly, exactly, you're right. Like, you know, when they were happier and wealthier than they could afford to be magnanimous or generous at times, not that you know, there weren't negative articles obviously written in the past or or what have you, but they could afford to be magnanimous at times. And then once once that was not the case. Well, they certainly weren't going to celebrate somebody funding round when they're just being layoffs at their friends, you know, journalism company, or you know, news organization, right. You know, local journalism is, you know, kind of going out of business. And so just, you know, tech got a lot of that stick, and it was all sublimated on but it's very real. And these disclosures, by the way, were never, you know, had had any company had such a massive conflict of interest that they covered and had not disclosed, that had a field day on it. Yeah, they did their own enormous conflict of interest on every level. This is the same thing, by the way with their articles. You know, many of these journalists, basically pick fights on Twitter, yell at people are extremely rude, nasty, and then cover the same people without any disclosure in their articles and basically settled personal grudges. Um, that's a very weird thing.

Unknown Speaker  25:41  
I almost feel like the journalist did themselves such a disservice by not acting magnanimous or classy on Twitter, and they just, you know, allowed anybody to go buck wild, and say whatever they wanted on Twitter, and it just, it made it clear that they had picked aside and that feels like another big mistake, you know, used to be able to, in your mind, think the New York Times was kind of taking it down the middle, CNN was gonna try to be down the middle, maybe they were a little bit left, Wall Street Journal was trying to be down the middle. But with the success of Fox News, it feels like everybody just decided, picking aside, gets subscriptions and gets people to your tribe. And going down the middle means you don't get the left or the right. So how much of this has to do with Trump being elected? Is that the third stage of all this?

Unknown Speaker  26:26  
Yeah, so Well, I mean, the thing is, there's actually a graph on record of all places, but it comes from a guy named Joe hobb. De HIV D. I'm actually maybe you can, I don't know if you can pull up a terminal on your screen. Yeah. Nick, see if you can pull this up on Google.

Unknown Speaker  26:42  
recode Facebook sentiment analysis? recode. Facebook sentiment analysis? Good. Yeah, he'll look for it. Explain what it is while he gets it up?

Unknown Speaker  26:51  
Sure. It basically shows that you and I are thinking is not, you know, all in our heads or whatever. You know, that will be another thing that often is done. Oh, what about this positive article, you're imagining, you know that there's negative coverage at all? You know, they'll do that that's a frequent thing to pull one article on. What this does, analyzes? Yeah, that's one and if you scroll down, this is actually its ricotta just reprinting an independent guys, you know that that graph, if you zoom in on that graph, it just zoom in, if you can, command Plus, there you go. So let's, let's take a look at this. Okay, starting, you know, everything was fine up until 2012. And starting in 2013, you can see it start trending down. And it goes from positive to neutral ish by early 2015. Way before Trump has come on the scene.

Unknown Speaker  27:43  
Yeah. And then Trump comes on the scene that's in the 2017 area, and you see Bo, we go super negative.

Unknown Speaker  27:50  
That's right. But but the critical thing is, it wasn't just Trump, it was definitely trending down for them. Okay, so, so this is this is something I mean, Trump was only on the scene, like May or June 2015, if I recall correctly, and but you can see that it's already, you know, the 2015 coverage is already starting to veer sharply negative relative to where it was at least it's around, it's around zero, right? As opposed to just trashing them all the time. Constantly, right. And so, you know, what, what often by the way, the reason a graph like this is helpful, is if you talk to a corporate journalist about this, and by the way, I, I want to make sure we use the term corporate journalist and citizen journalists, I'll come back to that. If you're not a corporate journalist about this, in really, they'll quote like one positive story in like the early 2018 story or something to be like, well see, there's a positive thing as well. So you have to actually use numbers like this, as opposed to words, because it's much harder for them to argue with numbers. I think that's a very, very important macro concept. Um, and you know, you can try arguing with words and

Unknown Speaker  28:55  
that that's useful when you're arguing words with people who are trained in words, you got to come at it with data and have any kind of chance at convincing them when we get back from this quick break. I want to know how much of that Facebook is self inflicted wounds from Facebook, the Trump effect, or the New York Times, maybe becoming more far left woke and anti corporate where do you see this sentiment coming from? Because Is it the same journalist writing those negative articles? Or did they replace the the classic journalists in tech and in business with a new breed of journalists Leah back on This Week in Startups? You crazy about efficiency like I am.

Thanks again to front for supporting our company with great software and for squaring the pockets. Let's get back to this amazing episode. All right, welcome back to This Week in Startups hope everybody's okay and taking care of their families. We're having a wide ranging discussion about late stage journalism, corporate journalism versus citizen journalism, social media, the media business with Balaji you know him follow him on twitter Ba La, JI s he is incredible at the Twitter. So when we look at that chart, and we see the sentiment is totally flipped. The New York Times goes from being you know, positive, you know, some critical stories here and there to being just almost universally, seriously criticism seriously criticizing Facebook. Do you correlate that with the journalists turning over there? Or journalists and the world fearing feeling powerless against Trump being in office and taking it out on Facebook for being neutral and helping in their minds put Trump in office? How do you unpack all that? Because there's so many factors here.

Unknown Speaker  32:19  
There's a few different factors, one factor that I think is under discussed but important, Nick Kristoff, who is a fairly honest guy at the New York Times, wrote a column I think it's titled, like the, you know, the columns you won't read or something like that came out a few months ago before the whole virus thing. But I think it was q4 and he essentially said that the columns that he hasn't mentioned Trump, get like, you know, far more pageviews and the ones that don't, and, you know, people talk about the Trump bump for journalism and what have you. So, so part of it is, you know, this, this thing where, you know, clearly there's, there's a strong financial incentive for them too, to mention Trump constantly and, you know, so on, on Trump, personally, I write Trump equals trading. So it's like this kayfabe II thing if you're that term kayfabe you know, tell me Okay, okay, maybe this is actually like Eric Weinstein's thing on Twitter if you if you if you know him, but yeah, of course, basically. Yeah. So like, you know, WWE, the World Wrestling, you know, Federation, or whatever the E stands for now, um, has fake wrestling matches, but they don't call them fake, they call them kayfabe, where it's actually fake, but everybody's supposed to, like play their roles or whatever, on both sides. Right. And so, we sort of had this kayfabe wrestling match until pretty much after the impeachment this year, and then the virus is bringing people into reality. So we had this silly back and forth. Nonsense, he, you know, a basically social cold war between, you know, these different factions, which I tried to stay out of as much as possible, because I think it's so stupid. And we're seeing it in our country, how stupid it is, where, because of that, there's people cannot agree on the basic biology of a virus that's going to kill people, you know. Um, but, uh, you know, and by the way, the the so called conservative media stock sells papers on this virus. I mean, I want to be clear about that, right?

Unknown Speaker  34:21  
It's an incredible fail all around. If we look at it, you had the right saying it's a hoax. This is just a continuation of Russia gate, the Ukraine gate, perfect memo. It's just all trying to get Trump out of office. And it's like, Okay, wait a second, under what circumstance would a virus be designed to take a presidential candidate out of office, you can argue with this, and then the left is so hysterical about this, they can't even have a sensible discussion about the virus. Let's get back to this third role, because you do have the left and the right who seemed to have lost because of Trump derangement syndrome or Trump loyalists. Have any conception of reality? And then you have citizen journalists, people who are looking at the numbers trying to have an intelligent conversation on Twitter about it, which I would put us into that sort of bucket. What do you see the role as citizen journalists versus the corporate journalists?

Unknown Speaker  35:17  
Yeah. So I have a piece coming out of this, which maybe you can share with your audience after this, but we'll have to face Yeah, basically. Um, so the title is decentralizing media. And the question is on because, okay, you can go and criticize, you know, corporate journalists work late stage analysts work on Twitter. And you know, that is that is fine to do. But ultimately, it is, like, you know, complaining to a company that you don't like their product at a certain point. You, you want to just go and build a better one. And how would you go about doing that? And also, we'll do

Unknown Speaker  35:55  
that, by the way, make a point. If you do that, then you're putting yourself into their crosshairs and their colleagues crosshairs. So when I defended you and use the term late stage journalism, I got Paul Graham, who doesn't give an F, which is what I love him, like, he's just like, I'm just gonna say I support Jason's position on short positions. I had for every person who publicly said like, right on there were 50, who dm to me or texted me and said, I would never mix it up with those journalists, I would never bring it up when I retweeted you. People are like, You're crazy, because they're gonna go after you now. And they're gonna try to attack you and attack your companies. And it's a real thing, people even if it's not true, people are scared. And I told this to Kara Swisher as well, who's I consider us friends, colleagues. You know, I, you don't want to be in a world where people actually scared to talk to you or think that you're going to do retribution, which I don't think Kara would ever do. But I do think there's some other journalists who like to circle the wagons and might actually take a swing at me, or take a swing at you, or whoever, just because we challenge them on the subject.

Unknown Speaker  37:01  
Absolutely. I mean, like, there's no question that there is retaliation, and that retaliation is intentional, premeditated, and often passive aggressive, where what happens is there's a conflict along one axis on Twitter or whatever, they'll try and hit a company on a at a later time on a different axis just to get them back for something. Right. Yeah. Actually, you know, who's admitted This is? I think Jon Ronson, in so you've been publicly shamed? You know, he mentions that there was there's some some person who you'd had a conflict with. And so we followed him closely to see if you could get that guy for something else. Oh, right. Wow.

Unknown Speaker  37:39  
It's like a dirty cop. And so

Unknown Speaker  37:41  
yeah, yeah, exactly. That's right. And, and so that's really interesting, because, you know, you start getting far away from the public interest there and going more to a personal grudge. And those things are of course conflated. And then, of course, you know, like, other things corporate journalists do, they'll, they will get a leak of information. And then, you know, they'll hold it over your head and try to bargain with you and say, Okay, give me more information. Or else I'm going to put this out there and write a negative story, right? And it's like negotiating with a terrorist who's has basically stolen information. I mean, you know, when Aaron Swartz went and liberated information from MIT servers, he was prosecuted for his troubles. And, you know, Snowden as well, had he not gone and paired up with a journalist who has a license to print secrets, essentially, for money. And thanks to the pen, you know, the pentagon papers and the, the Watergate precedents on and you know, New York Times versus Sullivan and so on. Like, essentially, media companies have special powers, where they can, they can do things they can't be initially sued for defamation as easily they can print secrets. Um, so that's like, actually a special privilege.

Unknown Speaker  38:51  
Yeah. whistleblower. Thank you. Yeah, it's an important role.

Unknown Speaker  38:54  
Right. Right. Right. But But here's the thing is, um, that is not actually granted to a normal citizen. No. Um, right. So. So it's something which is a symmetric and even the term subject, right. You know, and if you remember this, but you know, in Rome, people were citizens. And then once it became the Roman Empire, they were subjects, right. You know, subject has a dual meaning the subject of a story, but also the subject and the sense of someone who is subject to a rule of some kind, right? subjugated. subjugated? Exactly. So, um, I think that a bunch of these things are being reassessed. And I think that the goal is not just to criticize, though, that I think that is necessary. I think the goal has to be to build a different vision for what journalism is, and let me give a few riffs on that and a few thoughts. Okay. So there's really at least two major axes to this and one is the social and the second is the computational. So we talked about the social part first. So you know, I had a tweet storm on this and I've got a longer article. You know, coming discussing it. But there's this concept I have, and not just my concept, but the concept of a citizen journalist. Right. And I'm a citizen journalist is somebody who actually has a day job, and has expertise in some area. And frankly, that could be, for example, today, I would really like to hear from a, you know, an Amazon delivery driver, right? Or, or somebody who has, you know, a nurse, somebody who has on the ground experience who's not a professional writer, and because they're not a professional writer, because they're not a corporate journalist. Their incentives are not primarily those of clickbait and pageviews. and maintaining status within the journalist community, which is sort of like academia in the sense of, you know, it's kind of hard to leave academia and come back in, it's also kind of hard to leave journalism and come back in on you leave for PR something that that you're considered corrupt and selling out. Okay. So it's journalism is culturally centralized. Even if you start a new media company, I'll come back to you started new BuzzFeed, or Vox or vice, it'll eventually get pulled into the Brooklyn matrix. Because, you know, that's how the people you hire get Pulitzers. And you know, how they seem to advance in terms of getting props on Twitter and whatnot, right. So you need a different approach, you can't just start like a new media company. The alternative is to not have a media company, but to have every company be a media company, not have a special class of corporate journalists. But for everyone to become a citizen journalist. Because we need information to guide our society, we need true facts. The issue is the misalignment of incentives, that comes from having a separate and special media class. Now, the funny thing about this is their surveys of journalists where they themselves admit this like ny mag did something several years ago, where they will actually all admit that the separateness of them is an issue, that they are not demographically representative of the US, let alone the world. Um, and, you know, folks have talked about this, how many of them have, you know, trust funds? Many of them are, you know, actually from wealthy backgrounds, but they pretend that they're slumming it. I think Melissa k Chan on Twitter, talks about how to be a foreign correspondent, you need to have a trust fund or some money or something like that. And

Unknown Speaker  42:21  
why basically, you need to have the resources to be able to travel.

Unknown Speaker  42:24  
Yeah, exactly. Like, you know, it's, um, here, I'll find the exact one.

Unknown Speaker  42:30  
So, it's interesting when you bring this up, because they they do have this kind of bubble that they're living in. And when you get that group thing, if you're in that bubble, you're going to do things like, you know, you're gonna have this group thing, where, what percentage of the journalist writing for The New York Times hate Trump and voted for Trump, right? So they just, and I'm not saying I'm a fan of Trump, everybody knows, I'm not just to look at my Twitter handle. But right you do you get this group thing where they just have no conception of how they're perceived. And that is really a weak spot. And they don't know how they're perceived by the subjects. The subjects are like, Oh, my God, these journalists don't know what they're talking about. I'm trying to help them. I spend 30 minutes on the phone, 45 minutes on the phone, trying to educate them on the topic. And then they pull out two quotes. And they barbecue me. And it's like, oh, that I had the good faith to get on the phone with you and spend 45 minutes, and you didn't even have, you know, and I did that for you. Right. So here we go. I have the Melissa Chan quote, want to be a foreign correspondent? Sure. As long as you have no college loans, and can freelance for $200 an article for years. It's not impossible to make it on your own. But the secret is, a lot of us come from at least an upper middle class background and don't like to talk about it. Yeah, I mean, I don't think that's wrong.

Unknown Speaker  43:49  
And then if you go down a little bit further, it's like, you know, journalists are becoming increasingly like artists, people who pretend they're slumming it, many have at least a healthy rainy day fund or a small apartment of dismay on left them, you know, because industries that unstable and crazy. Oh, right, another way to be a journalist if you're married, and he or she happens to be a banker or a lawyer, right? And then, if you look at the second link that I sent, the media on the media, right. Um, the interesting thing is, you know, when they talk about the biggest issue associated with media, the thing that the thing that is the most legitimate issue is set number question or 12. journalism's biggest blind spot in its coverage is groupthink, we draw from a limited pool of people who generally have a similar background in class. They're simply unable to see the perspective of people who are not like them, and tend to drive out those who don't fit in. It is interesting, having been a journalist in New York, I can tell you it is its own group of people who have their own group think. And then when I moved out here and then running inside, it's very hard to find like journalists who just want to take it down the middle and try to pursue truth and we've had this ongoing discussion at inside Comm. Do we want journalists who

Unknown Speaker  45:01  
You know, have this kind of like, super far left leaning, anti capitalist, you know, agenda? Or do we want people to just want to report on the topic? And it's like, we just want to report on a topic as straight as possible. We're not actually looking to score points through virtual signaling on the meeting.

Unknown Speaker  45:21  
Yeah, I think I think the issue with folks tipping to one side or the other, because you also have obviously, you know, the fox, you know, thing. Um, you have Fox and you have Fox, right. Um, so, I think there's an interesting Z axis take on it, which is, it comes from full time, corporate journalism. So, you know, for example, the founding fathers had this concept of how a standing military was dangerous to the Republic, because you'd have a separate Praetorian class with on, you know, arms, that was well organized, and that if it thought of itself as separate from the citizens, it would have, you know, incentives would always be tempted to take over to abuse, its power in different ways, etc, right? Yeah, they'd be Hawks. Right? They would be their own class. They'd be their own class. Exactly. And, you know, this is that's something that is at least partially come to pass with the military industrial complex. And

Unknown Speaker  46:17  
politicians, it's come to class, right, like, also the founding fathers. So people would become politicians for one or two terms, and then go back to whatever the right jobs were.

Unknown Speaker  46:26  
That's exactly right. And so if the standing military is bad, the concept of a standing media, a media that is separate from and distinct from the people. So that leads to two different kinds of distortions, either a people think of themselves as the Guardian democracy or be people dislike them as, quote, the enemy of the people. But I think the solution is to be neither guardian of the people nor their enemy, but just the people.

Unknown Speaker  46:48  
All right, when we get back to this quick break, and final break, we're gonna go pull up that intelligentsia article from the New York magazine of 130 113 journalists answer the question, why they're so despise when we get back on This Week in Startups good teaser. Silicon Valley Bank is built to move bold ideas forward faster.

Alright, Bella, she's on the pot again, if you want to hear his first appearance, Episode 769 Ba La j is on Twitter, go follow him. He's got good things to say. Journalists biggest blind spot in coverage is groupthink, we draw from a limited pool of people who generally have a similar background class, simply aren't able to see the perspective of people who are not like them, and tend to drive out those who won't fit in. These are the writing responses. Well, for example, a distaste for views that don't support our own the environment, how income inequality ratio and the quality of let's say politics. Interesting.

Unknown Speaker  48:52  
Yeah, exactly. coverings, from the benefactors that there's there's, you know, not of toughness, then too much dark. This is it's useful, because it's actually like kind of an internal admission, and it says representative a survey is one is going to get, and I think the issue that people have been stuck in is they've been stuck in this, you know, false dichotomy of, Oh, you know, like journalism is bad. Oh, we need you know, good journalism, though. So we need to fund the same thing more. But a paradigmatically different approach is rather than having one journalist making, let's say, $100,000 a year, you have 100 people who make $1,000 a year, part time, they've got day jobs, but they have one or two or three articles a year and they make 1000 bucks from that. Yeah. And it's it's kind of something which is like the substack model, for example.

Unknown Speaker  49:44  
Yeah. And you essentially decentralized journalism, and you make it a large enough class that it's harder for them to collude. And they actually are the citizenry who are popping up to speak their mind and they actually have domain knowledge when they do so. You know what it's already happened. If you Look at podcasting. I think the reason podcasting has become so prominent is that people are looking at link baiting, and they don't trust the media media is at an all time low. The picking of sides, the tribalism, it makes people just feel icky. And they feel like it's just not healthy. And then when they listen to a Joe Rogan podcast, and they watch him interview, Bernie Sanders, or whoever he happens to be interviewing for two hours or three hours, or you and i doing an hour and a half, you can like, I've got a pretty good sense of what's going on here. And or a better sense, and I can really let the person unpack what they're saying, and you as the subject, like, how do I misrepresent you in this podcast, I'd have to do some post production, and really screw with the audio and always tell me we don't we only will ever take the audio is if you told us there was something you said that you regret. And you reasonably don't want to be misunderstood. And we're like, yeah, we don't want you to be misunderstood. Well, and that's happened twice in 1000 episodes, I think somebody said something they thought would be misconstrued and made a joke about communism or something, and they didn't want to be crass. So it's a true story that happened this year. And so I don't know, what do you think? Do you think podcasting his reaction to this? In some ways or solution? Maybe?

Unknown Speaker  51:16  
Yeah, so I think actually, podcasting is part of it. Um, so let me give my kind of 10 ish pointers on, it may not actually add up to 10, let's say and pointers on how to decentralize media. Um, so one of them is every company, a media company. And what I mean by that is, we, we need to go from content marketing to full stack narrative. And the entire podcasting that VCs have been doing is essentially the burgeoning of, you know, what I think of as the West Coast media ecosystem, where it's not just text, or audio, but it should soon become movies. And and everything, basically, tell your whole story. And there's a there's a site, which has, like 110 100 on, it's called the Gosh, what's the name of this site? Which is making videos Wistia? w is Wistia. Yeah. Yeah. So Wistia gives a good, I think a great example of what full stack narrative looks like. And full stack narrative is you do not have to go to somebody else for for distribution. I mean, for example, Rachel Maddow doesn't appear on Laura Ingraham show or vice versa,

Unknown Speaker  52:40  
right? Um, Tiffany has her own show,

Unknown Speaker  52:43  
they have their own show. Exactly. And so that's really it to kind of premise them. So first, every company, a media company, and relates to that, build your own distribution, to avoid distortion. You need basically, you know, for tech companies and for more more broadly, but the companies we invest in, but just really true for any company. Um, you know, 8090 95% of your content is stuff that is related to your vision and your mission and stuff that people find useful. On the next step after content marketing are, you know, videos that are helpful, all the type stuff, which which kind of tech has already been doing, right? Yeah, um, but what what is a new concept is that 5% of the time or 1% of time, you're going to get in a scrap where your company's reputation or brand is being attacked by often corporate journalists for to benefit their own companies, right? Because they get pageviews right, they they put your name which you've built up over the years into their headline and they get clicks and and they can literally make money from that because the anybody has right access to your reputation, they can debit from your reputation, whereas they can't debit from your bank account in the same way. Um, so the the distribution that you build up over years of providing useful content to your followers as a company can in that 1% case be used to actually fight back because that's how you have you know, a million or whatever million followers at the time so every company media company, build your own distribution to avoid distortion relate to this you know, the tech industry we've talked about learn to code you know, what comes after learn to code what

Unknown Speaker  54:29  
learn to write report publishing direct

Unknown Speaker  54:31  
love it. Yeah, maybe think about it. And this is the great irony the the woman, Sharon Jaffrey, who is that required me to, you know, pick on her in any way. I think she was like very new at her job at recode was just hired. She has 3000 followers and you have close to 200,000. So it's not like she's doing you any favor by including you in her you know, ridiculous article that People in because the punch line which we never got to in the beginning of the show was she said you predicted this article would be a hit piece, and would be would miss the mark. And it was I forgot the exact title. But it was like Silicon Valley people are strange for shaking hands.

Unknown Speaker  55:16  
Yeah. It was funny, because here's what I found remarkable about that. I called it out very publicly, right away. That's unusual. And, and it got a lot of flack for that from folks. I mean, some people support it definitely wasn't like 99 one, but it's like 5050, those people who, you know, had context and distrusted corporate journalists, corporate journalists themselves, and then folks who are in the middle who were like, Hey, why are you being mean to this person? overnight, right? Because it's set up to be passive aggressive, it's set up to be deniable, right? That's actually art on their side. And there was a really hilarious exchange, where, you know, I said this, this was going to be an article about handshakes on sand hill, and you know, this woman, you know, Golden Gate blonde on Twitter, and Kara both denied it, and they said, Oh, how do you know that? Are you a psychic? And the article came out, and it was, oh, no handshakes. You know, how Silicon Valley is terrified, and paranoid. Right? And, and it was kind of amazing, because they were on such autopilot. Because here's what they could have done, right? What they could have done is on, they could have taken the criticism, and either just shut the story down and done something else, or actually write the good story on the technologies that Chinese were using, and, you know, the supply chain issues and all that type of stuff. And either of those would have made me look like I was paranoid or crazy, right? Um, but instead they just, like, went down the middle in this kind of blind way. Because what they're not used to is their subjects being not subjects but citizens, yet isn't journalism, own and active participants who don't play along with it? Um, you know, for example, I'll give you another quote. Let me see if I can find this.

Unknown Speaker  57:05  
What was interesting as Kara Swisher responded to it, and her what she said was Oh, please with the dopey snark. She's doing story, a full story. And we have discussed every one of these issues raised in detail on pivot try to keep up

Unknown Speaker  57:19  
one thing I don't want to get lost in all this is this was the greatest crisis in modern American history, which is now obvious. Right? And, and that was apparent, you know, what I was trying to say was, look, this is a public health emergency. The Mayo Clinic says a pandemic, CDC said the virus may take a foothold. All of these things now take on a completely new light six weeks later,

Unknown Speaker  57:43  
every 14 just so people know. It's like a lifetime ago, and it's like six weeks ago at the same time.

Unknown Speaker  57:49  
That's right. Exactly. So so you know, and and the thing about it, the the useful thing about this particular episode, is a good chunk of the press has shaped shifted into Weaver right all along. And you know, like, Fox News is bad. Now, Fox uses definitely screwed this up in many different ways. Okay. But there wasn't a second for I mean, there's basically one person I think Alexis Madrigal, who actually reckoned with this, and is actually like a thoughtful person. And he's actually an honest person who I, I encourage people to read him, he's actually also helping he set the COVID-19 tracking and so on. So there's definitely, you know, pound not all journalists, right. Um, you know, but but a lot of them just kind of pretend this never happened. And have, you know, to use one of their favorite terms, gaslit people, which is, which is kind of this remarkable thing. And what they're leaning on and what they're relying upon? Is their distribution.

Unknown Speaker  58:49  
Yeah. Because their brand, right, and they're supposed to process and I've asked her like two or three times on dm, you don't know this. I asked her at least twice on dm and two or three times on Twitter publicly, Hey, are you going to give us an update? And I said earlier in the first segment here, I'm sure she's done an update, and they've done me a COPPA and explained what they got wrong in that story. So have they even followed up with you where they because that would be it would be such a credibility, building experience for them to say, Hey, you know what we should have?

Unknown Speaker  59:23  
You know, done this.

Unknown Speaker  59:24  
See, here's the issue is, if I press that, then it looks like I'm pressing some triviality from the past when people are dying, and so on and so forth. Right. However, if a tech company ever messed up in in this way, they would be hounded. I mean, remember, you know, I had it I had another tweet on this right. Um, people are fired for just a joke. What is the penalty for just the flu?

Unknown Speaker  59:52  
Yeah, right, right. Just the flu penalty should be like yeah, and so just a People know. The headline was no handshakes, please in question marks I mean in quotes, the tech industry is terrified of the Coronavirus. And it's like really? Come on like, and she says in the story that you should that, like there's no reason that, you know, the health officials are saying it's not that big of a deal.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:20  
Yeah, exactly. I mean, like, literally the story is official misinformation. It is riddled with, um, quotes that are misleading quotes that are selective, like quoting some anonymous county official, when national and international officials have said the opposite. And Wu Han is under lockdown saying that, oh, it's fine to be in Beijing when Beijing had an outbreak. Like literally every paragraph had had falsehood and not just falsehood, falsehood that was damaging to public health, as is now incredibly obvious, like, you know, clickbait helped cause lockdown. Right. Right. The reason people are cowering in their homes, is because the press failed as being a behavioral immune system as being an early warning. Crazy, you know, it's actually insane. It's literally caused trillions of dollars in damage, and thousands of lives dead. It. Yeah. I think this article alone, I'm just saying like, you know, the entire thing, you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:20  
let me ask you, since you do have some expertise here, and I have you on the line, what is the end game for the Coronavirus, and this pandemic? We have a month we have a month of mandatory quarantine here in San Francisco, the numbers out of China people believe are fake. But Hong Kong and Japan, South Korea supposedly are going back and have normalized the factories are refilled in China not sure if I believe that, is this going to end in your estimation. And when

Unknown Speaker  1:01:56  
it there's a huge, huge aerobars on this where literally the outcome can be different by multiple orders of magnitude depending on the choices people make at this time. Okay, and even even even still. So that want to preface it with that. So with that said, the US appears to be having a de facto let it rip strategy. Unfortunately, where I don't know if you saw but you know, a week ago, we were at about 100 new deaths per day. And now we've crossed 1000 deaths per day. And the testing may not be keeping up. So it may just go past that to 10,000 deaths per day or more on we may not even see the numbers. And that may give people a false insecurity because to you know, to scale testing to that level is is non trivial, right? Um, you may start to see it, as you've seen in Italy and already seen in New York City, and so called all cause mortality are familiar with that term. No, it's fine. As you can see on screen here, this is what a spike in all cause mortality looks like at the national level on if you scroll down. That is, if you see that huge spike. That's the Spanish Flu in 1918. And you can see that that's very visible on the graph, you don't need special statistical analysis to pull it out. It's a huge spike in deaths relative to the general trend in the 20th century,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:17  
right. And so overall infectious disease mortality rates have leveled off is the first one here and we're showing just Spanish flu is just a major peak, I think it was 1918 or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:28  
Yeah. And then we went crazy. And now the second link. So that seems spike is shown in a different way here. It's not a graph, but the table, if you click that table there, how many people are dying in Italy, so just zoom that zoom in on that? Just a table that there's an Italian engineer that I've been collaborating with? And we came up with the idea for this chart, and it's pretty bad. Um, basically, what that ratio shows is the ratio of deaths in the current week in Italy to the same week, the previous year.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:58  
Got it. So the number of deaths per week from the previous year is four to eight x. That's right. That's scary. You know, that's, that's crazy. Um, and you think they're greatly underestimated the number of deaths in Italy? And that came out eventually.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:15  
Yes, so so we publish this a great example of citizen journalism. This was online for those who saw it on and then it was written up in the Wall Street Journal Several days later. And it gave a lower ratios to accident include this table or graph or what have you. Um, but But yeah, you know, deaths are actually being underestimated. On because it's now the virus is at a scale where it's causing a change in all cause mortality, which is, which, frankly, terrifying, you know, it basically is, is something where it's such a blip, that it's all the people who are saying, Oh, just the flu. Well, guess what? I think as of yesterday, the virus has gotten to the scale where it is larger than any daily flu total has ever claimed on and it's one of those things where people are saying just the flu there. Comparing a constant or a rough constant to a variable on or really to an exponential. It's like It's like comparing a

Unknown Speaker  1:05:10  
Yeah, a car that standing still to a car that's going 100 miles an hour.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:14  
Yeah, yeah. Or, or to a, like a local restaurants revenues to data of a startup, right on which if a startup succeeds, it can be like $3 billion in revenue in five years on and local restaurant just does not have that upside. Typically, they're not built for venture scale,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:30  
the flus that we saw before we're just not capable of killing 1000 10,000 100,000 people a day.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:36  
Exactly, especially if they weren't going to go and scale from 1000 to 10,000 genders as it was more of a constant it was a known quantity, it wasn't going to mutate to such an extent, right? Um, okay, so she asked, like, what happens with this pandemic? I mean, I can give basically a couple of scenarios,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:54  
give me the best give us the best case scenario and then give us that the option the the expected, and then give us the, you know, we're Oh, my Okay, so.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:04  
Alright, so bull bull bear in base, right. Okay. It's her bull base, and bear. So the bull case is that there's some deus ex machina that comes into play, for example, masks for all SEO. Okay, if you just bring this up, actually,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:20  
let's see. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:21  
yeah. So this is by my, you know, colleague, Jeremy P. Howard becoming a friend on who basically has put together this great website, that is encouraging everybody, if you must go out wear a mask, it can be an improvised mask, it can be a cloth mask, made out of a T shirt. So so this is something which is a Deus Ex mokena not even dividend intervention, rather, which is cheap, which is scalable, which has no downside, which is easy to understand. And that which has worked in the Czech Republic, people believe Austria has made it mandatory, and certainly it's been a big deal in Asia. So it's possible that if we can get this out there, this could reduce the degree of contagion. Okay, you know, if 50% of population were mirror masks, you know, only 5% of the infected ones 80% wears a mask outbreak can be stopped immediately, holy cow.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:15  
This is incredible. And this is because and I was having this conversation with my wife. And we've been trading roles back and forth. I don't know, if you're having this in your personal life, where you're not taking this serious enough, you're taking this too serious. And we were just having this debate of if it's airborne or not, and there seems to be a big debate about is it airborne, it's not about it being airborne, it's about you touching your mouth after you touch something. Or if you're sick, you coughing and putting it on the table in front of you for the next person to touch. If everybody wore these goddamn masks, then anybody who has it, if they cough, it doesn't go all over the place. And then anybody who's using that mess, if they did touch the door handle for some insane reason they touch door handles with a bear and they might not touch their mouth and nose, they might only touch their eye. Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:00  
Right. So here's the thing, though, airborne is a technical term, where, you know, in the sense, can the virus be transmitted by a cough or sneeze? Absolutely, it can. That's droplets, right? Yeah, those droplets are flying through the air. Airborne is like a more technical term, which is like, you know, is it is it born on the air? You know, is it like flying through the air even without like a droplet? But absolutely, masks protect you from spreading it to others on they stop you from touching your face. And I believe they will also protect, you know, it depends on the kind of mask but they can prevent some viral particles from coming in. It's one of these completely common sense interventions that's cheap and scalable. That, of course, of course, we haven't done

Unknown Speaker  1:08:43  
yet. And it's so obvious Japan has always done this, and they get through flu season, and Japan is the most dense place in the world. And they know something about what they're doing.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:53  
That's right. I mean, Japan is, you know, people think it's screwing up a bunch of stuff. And it might actually have an outbreak. But it hasn't been extremely bad yet, despite very high population density and so on, because people have this culture of wearing masks in public

Unknown Speaker  1:09:07  
and washing hands and being sanitary.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:09  
That's right. That's right. So I think, you know, if you can get people to wear masks, that could be something that could bring this temperature down considerably. It's also possible there's other kinds of things which I'll enumerate on maybe some miracle drug is found with which has high effect size. And by the way, it's often not just the drug, but it's the formulation and the dosing. And, you know, when you have it, like, you know, you have it early in the course of the illness, all those kinds of things matter, not just the drug itself, right, you can iterate on a drug, just like we iterate our product. This is something people don't know. Yeah. So maybe there's some drug maybe, you know, we get a vaccine. Well, this was not going to happen on any short term timescale. But Marc lipsitch of Harvard is proposed something very, very important that your audience should Also know about, I tweeted this very brave for him to publish this. And he he deserves our support. Okay. On essentially, he talked about a challenge trial, do you know what that is?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:11  
No, it's fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:13  
So a challenge trial basically is you take healthy people, you give them an experimental vaccine, and then you actually have them exposed to the virus and well dose in a controlled environment. not okay. And so this way, you're not just doing like an observational study of who gets it or who doesn't, you know, out in the wild, right? You are, you're actually exposing them on purpose to a known viral load. And it's in a controlled environment. So if they get sick, they have the best hospital care and so on, they get paid for doing it, you know, they're volunteers, etc. And this could radically accelerate progress towards not just a vaccine, but trials of multiple different kinds of vaccines. Because you'd basically see whether the vaccine worked, so we could get there.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:58  
Good. Let me unpack that. So now we're doing human trials on the vaccine, these people are opting into it, and they're getting paid some large amount of money to do it. But yeah, this flies against everything that we think about in terms of individualism and classism, and you know, who would have to take this money to do it? Yeah, so these people would be heroes for doing it. And if you ask people to volunteer for this, especially if they were young people, or on the younger side, who were lower risk, this could be like incredible service, that would be the equivalent would probably be less dangerous than going into a war zone.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:35  
That's exactly right. I mean, basically, the issue is on America is now paying the risk averse premium, right? You've heard the term the risk premium. Yep. After 50 years, you know, Peter teal was one of the the was the person really, who pointed this out earlier and more loudly than anybody else. America for 50 years has become unable to innovate in the physical world, because it's been unwilling to take physical risk, which means people people can die in the physical world, you know, yeah, build a building can collapse a drug might not work, a vaccine might not work. But the issue is, is that if you don't take any physical risk for 50 years, you become unable to quickly innovate in the physical world. And then you start to try to solve a virus crisis with a trillion in stimulus, right? Yeah. Which is, which is not the right thing, you know, and the biology of it, that the virus is going to kill you otherwise. So the virus is sort of waking people up to the fact that if you don't take calculated physical risk along the way, and uncalculated physical risk will be imposed on you. And and then you're in trouble.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:37  
I'm trying to do a thought experiment here just on a morality basis. And I'm no Sam Harris, but I'm friends with him. If you were to put out there, that how many people would you need to do these kind of trials to have a chance at finding something quicker? 10,000 100,000 1000.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:53  
Um, so I don't know the exact number, I think it will depend upon, like, let's call it, let's put let's probably in that range, that's right.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:00  
Um, so I'm going to pick a number 5000 5000 people, and you give them a million dollars each. Pretty sure that's $5 billion. We, though there are 5000 people right now, who would say, in fact, me, give me the million dollars tax free, I would like to take that opportunity. And there are other people who are going to war as soldiers for 60,000 or 50,000, a year for 20 years, and probably have a greater chance or being in a deep sea, you know, like people were cleaning windows or whatever. So you're basically compressing the danger into one month, and then giving them this big reward. It's dystopian, and it's hard to talk about. But there's 5000 people who would want to do that 100%.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:48  
So I don't think this is dystopian at all. In fact, I think it's actually a it's actually putting us back on a on a positive courses to society, the dystopian course, would be one where we don't take any physical risk at all. And then we're wiped out by something where, you know, you had to take physical risk in order to beat it on. And what I mean by that is, we only recently have airplanes, there were test pilots, you know, their folks willing to risk their lives, the only reason that we have anything in space, is because folks risk their lives. And in some cases, like on the challenger, they they died. by recent we have a US military, again, people are willing to risk their lives. And today, people are allowed to risk their lives for bungee jumping or skydiving, you know, they're allowed to do those things. So they're allowed to do it for on casual reasons. But somehow they're not allowed to do it for society or to make money or for both,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:39  
right, yeah, to help to help save the save the planet. And because economics is there, but if you think about it, a lot of people are doing very dangerous things like playing football for millions of dollars a year, and they're short of getting brain damaged is the perfect example.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:52  
That's right. That's right. So we're in this paradoxical spot where the less decidedly valuable the risk that is being taken, the more permissible It is

Unknown Speaker  1:15:01  
right wingsuits these people jump or actually go Alex Honnold, Honnold, whatever his name is, who climbs, you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:11  
climbs mountains without ropes, the free climbs, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:13  
The base, the BASE jumping type stuff also, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:16  
it's just like people are doing this for the rush where they're getting paid in adrenaline for something that you want out of every 500 people who does dies, is

Unknown Speaker  1:15:24  
That's right. And, and other people have to clean up the mess, you know, typically, right? Yeah. And so, so this is something very different where, so let's call this the vaccine. The challenge trials, I think are really, really important thing that we should support. Because also, here's the thing, even for the person who's doing it, they could just have a personal risk adjusted calculus that they'd rather be of 1000 people, or 100,000, or 10,000. Actually, it's in the range of 2000 to 8000. I looked at the site size of these, you'll see it's like 50,000 people, okay. Those folks are exposed to this. And on Yes, you know, the vaccine may not work, yes, they have a percentage chance of getting it, but there would be treated in a hospital setting, which was optimized and set up for this. And they might might actually have a better outcome than the alternative scenario of where the virus spreads through the population crashes every hospital, and then that person as well not be able to get medical care,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:19  
right. I mean, when you think about it that way, it's almost like, we have this invading alien species. And we're like, we're gonna send some people up to the moon to fight them there. before they get to Earth. It's like, well, you can either wait here and get killed here. And you can die. Or you can die on your feet, and you can put up a fight. I mean, that's right. And can you imagine the snowflake reaction to even just hearing this concept is gonna short circuit people's brains?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:41  
Right. Well, so here's the funny thing is, Mark's paper has gotten a good reception right now. It has. And I think that I think that, you know, Jeff Lewis has mentioned this, I think the virus broke, woke. Because broke, woke. Yeah, for sure. Right, like real problems, rather than fake problems, um, you know, are basically taking away clicks and frankly, relevance from book after this. It's hard to get, you know, to head up about a microaggression when there's a very macro aggression in the form of the virus, right? species ending versus microaggressions. Really like the exact opposite ends of the spectrum. Yeah, exactly. And this is not so you know, I remember talking to somebody about this, this is not species ending in the sense of, if you, you know, like scientific notation, one, E, one, e 01, e, one, and so on, like, 10 to the zero 10. To the first and so on, right? Like one e six is a million. You're familiar with that, right? Yeah. I'm on that scale, where one E zero is one death. And one e 10. Is 10 billion deaths and the end of humanity? Yeah, this is not a 10. Right. But it is potentially a six to an eight, right, which is like between a million to 100 million deaths depending on you know, where we, we catch it? Right? And it is, it is already, um, you know, looking at the latest, you know, tools. It's already a, I think 100,000 deaths. Where's, where's the numbers at today? It was 50,000 deaths. Okay. But let's say it's probably going to get to 100,000 deaths, right? So it's, it's already one e five, but it's between 24 and 25. Um, so yeah, it's not a 10. It's not the end of life on Earth. But it could very well be a six, seven or an eight, which is a million to 200 million dead. And 100 million is a really bad scenario. But that's if this just goes rampant in Africa and South America and other places that don't have great health care systems. Because if it's doing what it's doing in the US, who the heck knows what it can do? Let me do another

Unknown Speaker  1:18:37  
politically incorrect exercise with you. Please, snowflakes, if you're listening, please cancel me so I can retire. I've been asking you guys, I'm going to be 50 in November, trying to retire by 50. And the only way I'm gonna get there is if you cancel me, because I'm going to keep going to work. But if I opened a chicken farm in upstate New York, and I don't know, two or three, pandemics, just giant outbreaks occurred there. Who's responsible?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:07  
Right, yeah. So So, you know, this is basically the question of, you know, China and wet markets and should they shut them down and so on and so forth. And they shut

Unknown Speaker  1:19:15  
them down last time. And, and then they reopened them. So if I will this and I killed a bunch of people, I shut it down. And then I reopened them. I reopened my chicken farm in upstate New York and kill more people who's responsible me. And we are we allowed to talk about the fact that the Chinese have some responsibility here for these wet markets, or no, is that politically incorrect? So that

Unknown Speaker  1:19:38  
No, I mean, like, you know, it's certainly like a

Unknown Speaker  1:19:42  
well, okay, here's how I

Unknown Speaker  1:19:44  
I saw a report recently that said that the wet markets had been allowed to reopen. And but the thing is that I've seen so much incorrect reporting in other areas that I always take the stuff with a grain of salt. Yeah. And I want to see a second and a third and a fourth count. formation actually like a crypto concept, by the way, you know transaction doesn't go through until you've seen multiple confirmations.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:05  
Well, I'm not even talking about now reopening. I'm talking about after SARS and all these other things have occurred. Oh, and there's been these like huge. Like, there's been this huge outcry because I did a search prior to 2019 people talking about what marks and I went down the rabbit hole. And I found all these people saying after SARS and the bird flu and all this stuff, Hey, you got to shut these things down. This is way too dangerous to be killing. Pangalos is that the name of the animal panke pangolins Angolans, which I didn't even know this animal existed before this bats and all these other things and they want to cut them up and butcher them live, which I understand is that I've eaten sushi live I've had I've had all these like fresh things. I understand the like desire to have fresh cuisine. But it's too dangerous. It's too dangerous for these things to exist. And well, they don't just exist in China, by the way, they're in Africa and other places. Yeah, the zoonotic stuff. This means a this, this is the source of these outbreaks, correct?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:58  
Well, yeah, I mean, that is, that is certainly the hypothesis. Now, um, you'd have to do so called molecular phylogenetics. To really get at the root of it. I'm looking at a file genetics will basically reconstruct like an evolutionary tree that shows which viruses are related to which other ones and there might be some archival work, maybe maybe it wasn't bats, for example, it was pangolins. That kind of stuff people can try and figure out Yeah. But But yeah, I think certainly as a precautionary measure, those markets should be closed. And that's such as a public health measure. It's like a global health measure. Yeah. It's just crazy that that is not even a topic right now. Well, so, but I will give one asterisks on it, which is, I think, um, yes, there's a lot of stuff, a lot of people to blame on this. And I think, you know, China's certainly, you know, shares some significant responsibility for this whole thing on however, you know, it's one of those things where, you know, the neighbor shouldn't have been playing with matches, but we need to put out the fire on our own house before going in yelling at the neighbor. Right? For sure. Yeah. Yeah. From a focus standpoint. The other issue is, from a pragmatic standpoint, I'm starting to fight with China, when all the manufacturing is over there. Maybe this is

Unknown Speaker  1:22:14  
already not.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:16  
It's not the right time to do that, you know, like, and the problem is, they're already doing things where they're blocking PP exports, the US. And, you know, it's just, look, I think that China is a huge country, it's 1.4 billion people. And while I certainly don't agree with, you know, a lot of things to do, I also want to recognize that they really did innovate a lot in terms of trying to stop this virus, and a lot of their medical workers were very brave, and risked their lives to go and fight it. So it's, it's a big country that's got internal diversity, just like the US, you know, not everybody here agrees with every policy of the government. And so and so I want to also be careful to paint with a broad brush, there's a bunch of Chinese who are just as angry as at their countrymen and countrywomen for for having these wet markets as, um, you know, people in the US are mad at other people for not social, just, I mean, people,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:07  
people also, I think, don't know the history of it. But HIV and AIDS, the leading thesis is that people eating chip me, which is called bushmeat, which some people do is that that's how it actually jumped into the human species.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:24  
Yeah, I've heard that hypothesis. I don't actually know the latest on it.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:27  
Yeah, I just know, that was the they knew it came from chimps, and monkeys and chimps eating monkeys, and then humans eating chimps. But the whole thing is, and what do you think about this mass testing? And why we're not there yet? I mean, if you were talking about this in jail, boy, how come we're not we don't have mass testing already online. And then if we could all just get tested every week and wear masks? Which seems like we're, I don't know, 30 days away from being able to do if we could all get tested within 30 days a mess. Aren't we all gonna just go back to work?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:05  
I don't think so. And the reason is that, well, okay. Masks could help these vaccines, because, you know, just to recurse back up, yes. What's the bull case? The base case, the bear case, right? So the bull case is we get interventions like a masks, right? Yeah, everybody wearing masks when they go out? On be stay at home? Unless you have to go out right? Um, see, maybe these challenge trials, we could accelerate things on D, you know, scaling up test. The problem is that on scaling of tests, we need something paradigmatically different because it is it is something where to scale up tests. You're behind the exponential now. You know, so it's not trivial to run these tests at a large scale. So when you're talking, there's a big difference, as you know, between 100,000 tests a week, a million tests a week, 10 million tests a week. The virus doesn't care it uses it lives off the land. Right, it just uses your own body to just wreck your own body. But we don't have I mean to scale damage testing capacity that quickly is actually non trivial. So a paradigmatically different approach would be something like diagnostic grade wearables, where you just wear rings or things like that at all times. And that is just taking a lot of telemetry and uploading it. And there's already a lot of on, you know, individual evidence that those kinds of things can can predict the onset of this disease, both individuals who've had the temperature on these. Yeah, exactly. It's the temperature, but it's also, um, you know, heart rate, cussing seems to attack the heart, right? There's a bunch of subtle signals, right? Um, but in terms of things that can be rolled out, so just to recap, a, maybe, you know, people get masks out there, hopefully, yeah, be maybe the challenge trials get a vaccine out faster. See, maybe there's a miracle drug. D, um, you know, we we have some deus ex machina, for example, you have more natural cross immunity to the Coronavirus. And we thought on because there's other coronaviruses. So maybe your antibodies bind to this one. I think it's shot in the dark. But Nobel laureate, Michael Leavitt has proposed that or some some factor, we don't understand that makes it drop off, maybe it does, like, you know, doesn't do as well in the summer. And that's enough to bring it down. That's that's the bull case that there's some intervention that brings the virus down. Okay. What's the base case? I think the base case is even if the virus went away tomorrow, the economic devastation of lockdown, and, frankly, the crash of the healthcare system, and the supply chain disruptions from overseas, and the closing of borders, um, you know, pausing the economy like this, for many companies, it's like you tell somebody to hold their breath for 20 minutes, and you come back, you're like, oh, here's all here's all the oxygen you need. It doesn't work like that. You might get all the oxygen in the world at the end of that doesn't matter. It's too late. Right? Too late. Um, and, and so like, essentially, we have faced, we're seeing total demand destruction in much of the the cold, the want areas of the economy, right. So the white areas are travel, entertainment, physical entertainment, at least, concerts, events, restaurants, even everything that's a want, basically, you know, often involves being around other groups of strangers, movies, and movies. Right, exactly. So those are just going to zero physical movies, physical movie theaters, on and then the needs have dramatically risen, of which biomedicine is huge. Number one, and then food. And, you know, just just like basic, we're down the Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right? You know, people, people are just talking survival in many ways. Um, and so that itself is an enormous re, a billions of people have had their utility functions changed. permanently. And so so even if everything quit, went back to work, people will be afraid to go to movie theaters, or get on airplanes. It's just not gonna like snap back like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:16  
I think it'd be quick for people who have short memories, like, we had this thesis about people flying after 911. And they came back quick. So it really depends on if we have that second wave, right. And the chances of that are 100%.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:30  
I mean, like looking at all past, you can never say 100%. But looking at past pandemics, I posted some of the graphs on this. But they do seem to come in waves, h1 and Moon came in waves, Spanish Flu came in waves. It's not just a straight exponential, it peaks it drops, people could get back to work, and then it comes back like a predator. Really only a vaccine can can really stop it. So I think the base case is a, frankly, a generational rebuild. And the reason I say a generational rebuild is, you know, this, even though this is a not an economic event alone, it's really a biological and physical event. Certainly it has economic ramifications. And if you look at the graph of you know, the great recession that took 10 years to come back, right. And there is a there's a really good tweet, which you might you know, put up on screen. I'm going to find it by this guy who points out this was two weeks ago, by the way, March 18. said on so as best as I can tell this morning, we now have a pandemic crisis a supply chain crisis, a demand crisis a labor market crisis and equity market crisis and oil prices crisis a brewing bond market crisis a developing currency crisis a potential housing market prices

Unknown Speaker  1:29:49  
Yeah, anything I left off the table there. Yeah, you crisis. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:54  
It's Yeah, well, we, you know, we we probably more That's right. I see use drugs. Exactly. Like we haven't seen or things like, you know, so the most scary things to me are, you know, the headlines like, and you come from a family of police. So I'd actually like to hear, you know, reverse the interview a little bit and hear your take on this.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:12  
Yeah, I know that the headline, the striking Amazon workers and the police having 6% not show up for work are the ones that make me nervous, if that's the headline that's about to pop up. That's right. That's

Unknown Speaker  1:30:25  
exactly right. And and not just that, but also the aircraft carriers getting shut down. Right. So, um, I mean, the ramifications of that are tremendous, because basically, the virus is sinking our battleships or at least it's it's putting them on shore, you know? Yeah. And, and that's true, not just for one aircraft carrier, but it's the entire US Navy, it's every nuclear submarine. Yeah, like, so if it's sickening police, and if it's putting military personnel on shore and having them sitting in hotel rooms, shields her down yeah, in a way that they've never been before in society almost makes you feel like this was a biological weapon designed to benefit somebody. Not that it's possible because you I mean, let's let's explore the absurd for a moment.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:15  
Would there be any circumstance where this could potentially have been created by humans? I mean, it's obviously potentially possible but did your as your mind ever gone there for a moment when you heard China created this in a bio lab? Is that Oh, how to create something like this in a bio lab? Okay, so I'm gonna just send you a link just to post Okay, this is from 2015. So, here we go. The scientist lab may Coronavirus, triggers debate the creation of chimeric Am I pronounce that correct SARS, like virus si

Unknown Speaker  1:31:46  
Chi Merrick. So this by the way, let me just give context on this, you're asking a question of, is it possible? I'm only going to answer that question of is it possible from a scientific standpoint? Okay. I'm not speculating. I, I personally do not believe it was a bio weapon or anything like that, you asked, Is it possible to create a more deadly virus in the lab, as a scientist that it is possible to do that? Okay. So this in you know, 2015 basically, and you can see there update at the top, okay. But, um, you know, essentially, it is possible that a more deadly virus could be created in a lab. And this is actually a study that is, you know, from 2015 being discussed controversial study, so called gain of function mutation.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:35  
That, you know, makes me to

Unknown Speaker  1:32:37  
pass it on, it's been done.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:40  
It's been done, and you have people in the article saying things like, you know, a viral ship parachute if a new virus escaped, no one could predict trajectory on these are nh director Francis Collins, these studies entail biosafety and biosecurity risk, which needs to be understood better. So those are, you know, like, like credible people who were saying gain of function research is dangerous. Now, um, the reason that people are doing gain of function research, is they want to understand how these things could become pathogenic. How could they could mutate, there's, there's, there's a genuine scientific rationale there, right? Which is, you know, you could say, Oh, hey, this thing isn't bad right now. But one base pair alteration, it could get really bad. So we need to design our vaccine for that, for example, that's what one reason, okay, so it's not, I want to be clear that it's not necessarily malicious work. It's just like, um, you know, it's sort of like a playing with with nuclear isotopes or radio isotopes, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:33:40  
Yeah. Um, don't do it.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:43  
Well, or just be really, really careful, you know, and it's, it's something where you, there are downsides. The second link that I sent is from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. And, again, you ask, just like, Is it possible? I'm not talking about whether it's probable so this is for the volta, and this is a credible organization, Bolton, the Atomic Scientists, you know, experts know, the they're basically folks who've been focusing on you know, like, like tail risk type stuff, right. Expert knows new Coronavirus is not to buy a weapon. They disagree on whether it could have leaked from a research lab. Right. And that summarizes the article. Okay. Now, um, you know, my personal belief is I think that the, the, is probably a zoonotic thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:31  
All right. They are the experts agree that it isn't the product of human engineering, and the ant eating pangolins, as we discussed previously, are potentially the source.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:43  
Yeah, but basically, like, the thing is, the penguin theory hasn't been I mean, you know, you have to do like a bunch of archaeology, essentially, when everything is calm down to figure it out. And China may not want you to ever do that archaeology. You know, I'm so so so you know who like whatever. What I'd say is, um, you asked me whether it was possible for this to be lab made. I showed you an article from 2015 that shows that it is possible to add gain of function to Coronavirus and another thing for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. But I want to be absolutely clear. I'm not saying it's bioweapon. I'm not saying that China did or anything, I don't think we should start a fight with China. I think that that could be the absolute worst thing that the world needs at this point. Um, and so. And I also think that, you know, for such an extraordinary claim, you need incredible evidence, which we do not have. And so even speculating about it, or something is, you know, is not responsible. So that's why I just want to be clear about that. You asked me a possible question, I gave you a possible answer, but I don't think it's probable.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:48  
All right. Well, this is a terrifying moment in time, but it feels to me like we will get through this and we'll be stronger before what if we, as we wrap up here? What is the lesson that humanity needs to learn? coming out of this, so that when the next one comes, and instead of having, you know, a bunch of people who are asymptomatic and a small number of people who you know, die? What if it's the opposite, you know, and people, a lot of people are symptomatic, and a lot of people die, because there have been these kind of viruses. From what I understand that could have a 30% death rate. What do we learn here? Well, so what are we learning? We've learned, ideally, what should we learn?

Unknown Speaker  1:36:31  
Yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  1:36:33  
one thing is the 2020s are going to be the decade of biology. So essentially, you know, biotech has been, you know, operating for some time. But now, I think biotech and tech merge, because everybody now, I mean, just like after the financial crisis, you had a greater interest in finance. Yep. Because it affected you. Yeah. I can't count the number of engineers, entrepreneurs, etc, who asked me for intro to bioinformatics intro to, you know, like, how to how to work with viral sequences, that type of stuff. Um, and I think that, you know, this has already been there with things like health kit, and Fitbit and whatnot, with wearables, that's like one angle of like, help. Also, EHR is EMRs, there have been areas of tech and biotech that have intersected, but I think they become, you know, like, it becomes a major thing. And every tech VC gets into this. Number one, number two is I think that the, you know, when we talk about the budgets moving over from want to need, the budgets for bio are going to be essentially unlimited this decade, at the individual level, the corporate level, the government level, defense budget level. And, you know, because this is not the last pandemic, um, one of the issues people have been talking about COVID-19 potentially becoming endemic, which is to say it recurs periodically in mutant form. So you have COVID. Yeah, so COVID, 22, and COVID, 26, and so on. So we need to do is like, absolutely level up our bio, you know, our biomedical science. So so we're pulling technologies from 2030, or 2050, or 2100, into the present, like the Manhattan Project, so that we can, you know, for example, john Iron Dome is the national defense. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:17  
Oh, yeah. Missile Defense? Yes, of course.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:19  
Yeah, it's really it built a missile defense system that moves at the speed of the missile. So you know, the missile comes up, and you don't have time for like a human targeted, you have to have an autonomous system that tracks the missile. And as people say, hit it's a bullet with a bullet, you know, knocks that thing out of the sky, right, and does so in a safe way that doesn't land on, you know, people and what have you. So just to move at the speed of the missile, and we are going to need is, you know, a pandemic defense system that moves at the speed of the virus actually talked about this in the context of what China would do. You know, I think this is going to be China's third Great Wall, great wall, Great Firewall, Great Firewall of China, where they're just scanning the population constantly. They're looking for these viral fires breaking out, somebody who has a high temperature because they've got temperature checks everywhere, you know, and then they quarantine that person, they probably quarantine maybe the people around them, but they stop it from becoming epidemic. And they isolated them from their family and they just keep doing this. It's similar to Tomas pull us post the hammer in the dance, they managed to like knock the virus down such that it wasn't crashing the healthcare system. But they have to scan for it constantly, until they can get a technology that they can vaccinate people and just, you know, stop it entirely,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:35  
you know, then can't see being abused in any way. Like some political rivals like oh, yeah, no, no, we took this person because they were sick. We saw their biometrics and we arrested them and put them in jail because they went out with a temperature of 104. That's

Unknown Speaker  1:39:49  
exactly so the problem with this is, you know, and I I tweeted about this very early on, because, you know, frankly, one of the reasons I was also thinking about this beyond the critical importance for public health is the philosophical challenge it poses to, you know, like, like a pro freedom worldview. You know, because, you know, I tweeted about this on February 3, I think it holds up fairly well. But you know if the Coronavirus goes pandemic, and it seems to me the extreme edge case becomes the new normal. It's every debate we've had on surveillance and D, platforming and centralization all accelerated. Right, it's emergency powers for the state even more than terrorism or crime. And, and the way I think about it is, you know, sometimes, so there's a and there's B, and then there's C. A would be okay, quarantine everybody, just let the state unleash go after it. B is, hey, there's a lot of side effects to the unlimited government, you sure you want to give these people that much power, because they're going to abuse it very quickly over time, you know, even if even if it does solve the problem, and then C is, well, I, you know, we may have no option in both senses of the term, both you as an individual are powerless to stop it. And society has no option other than this kind of quarantine, you know, surveillance system. But you, you know, you you can't stop it from happening. What you can do is build a decentralized alternative to check their power. And I think what that's going to mean is the virus is accelerating both centralization and decentralization, centralization in the sense of states are powering up where they can essentially imprison innocent people. Right, that's what quarantine is of the form that you know, boo Han was its quarantine entire city, you know, 11 million people are exposed, considered expose, right? On scale is, is like the Soviet Union, where you had an internal passport system to get between places that's coming, you're going to need proof of health, to get into every building, to get into every company to get into every country. It's in a sense, it's just an extension of vaccination certificates where you need that already to get into the US. But it's like real time vaccination certificates each present

Unknown Speaker  1:41:58  
real time proof of we're all gonna be wearing like those wristbands you get a Disneyland with the RFID in them. It's gonna be Yeah, yeah, you want to get on the bus, you wanna get on the subway? Sure, we're going to take your temperature, we need to see your biometrics, we're going to need to see your pass, you're gonna have to have been tested.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:11  
That's right now. Now, one fortunate thing is that with crypto and with, you know, not just blockchain stuff, but also secure multi party computation, private join and compute. There are technologies that will allow people to present proof of health without revealing other things about themselves.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:30  
Yeah, absolutely. And that would be Yeah, perfect. It'd be amazing if the actual use case behind money starting transfer for crypto and smart contracts and blockchain and all of this wound up being proof of

Unknown Speaker  1:42:45  
not sick proof of health, exactly how and, and, and so that's, you know, it's in once once a vaccine is out, it's your vaccination, if you don't have vaccines, the serology test, where it shows that you're already immune to at least this particular variant, and you can go all the way back to Did you have a fever, check, you know, an hour ago, that's a lower quality test, but it's something so, so I think proof of health becomes a big thing. And if you can do private or privacy, preserving proof of health, we may be able to preserve some of the norms of Western civilization, rather than being like under this constant surveillance thing. And I do think that, um, you know, I said, centralization gets powered up by this, I think decentralization also gets powered up, in the sense that people have seen the FDA fail, they've seen the CDC fail, they have seen, you know, the press and the state at every level, city, state federal level fail. They've seen hospitals, as valorous, as doctors and nurses are many of them who are treating this in the front lines. You know, many of them also, you mean, the hospitals were not prepared, or they're trying to prevent doctors from going on speaking about, I think

Unknown Speaker  1:43:50  
it'd be the big thing that comes out of this is, we started realizing we opt we just optimized for optimization, and speed and yeah, for resiliency, not to be anti fragile not to be redundant. And, you know, we just got too obsessed with efficiency and taking out friction and not enough with, yeah, you know, maybe we should put a spare tire in the car, like, you know, of course, you always have a spare tire, and now it's like, you don't need a spare tire. It's like, we need some fucking spare tires. Right about now, you know?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:18  
That's right. We're basically a leveraged society. Right? Well, where more upside came with expensive, more downside? Um, because yeah, like, take that spare tire example. Yeah, you have less weight. And in the base case, you're spending less money on gas. But in the downside case, you're in a much worse situation. And you multiply that across society in many, many different ways. I think that's, that's where we are. And then I think that's where we're going to have to fix Yeah, which is beds per citizen is we have

Unknown Speaker  1:44:43  
to rethink that. You know, do we make drugs in this country anymore? Do we have manufacturing in this country, and we're really stress testing.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:53  
You know, can America survive without China?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:56  
Well, yeah, so I think what's going to happen on this the one thing that America It does have another one thing, one of the things that America does have going for it is shale oil. Right. And it's got huge, you know, like fields in the middle of the country. So it can become energy and food self sufficient, which is good. It has the natural resources to do that. It's not an island. However, the the rethink, so you mentioned like beds per citizen, I think we have to rethink a lot of things. So that's not on beds at a hospital, but it's your bed at your home. Yeah. And we're pushing medicine to the individual, you're putting all this diagnostic stuff into the phone. By the way, this is actually something where the FDA helped cause this pandemic in many different ways. One way is the most obvious way that people know about where cdrh the FDA is devices division, essentially blocked emergency use authorizations for tests during the crucial month of February, such that we were flying blind. But there's other ways as well. Even more recently, they're blocking at home tests. So they're forcing people to essentially go to COVID-19 meetups meaning hospitals. Yeah, and send it send a line, you want to send it a COVID-19 test? Yeah, no

Unknown Speaker  1:46:05  
way to test if you have it, if you didn't have it, now, you have to have to come into the waiting left behind and getting online.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:11  
That's exactly right. And it's basically a risk calculus that is simply divorced from reality. Because, um, you know, okay, yes, it's possible that you mess up sample collection at home. But if that happens, there's actually ways to detect it, for example, you have positive negative controls at the lab, and you can detect if somebody didn't click the sample, there isn't human DNA on it, right? It's like a unit test, right? Prior to an integration test. You have pre flight checks before you just release a test them and say you don't have it. Okay. Um, so, so number one, they blocked, you know, the UAS. Number two, they blocked the at home tests. Number three, this is more subtle, but six, seven years ago, Apple was trying to do an apple watch that was actually bristling with more sensors. Yeah. And you know why they didn't do it? Let me guess,

Unknown Speaker  1:46:58  
the FDA.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:59  
Exactly. And this is reported at the time, The Wall Street Journal, okay. FDA forced them to actually take out sensors and nerf the Apple Watch. Because essentially, what have happened is Apple becoming an FDA regulated business means that they're under so called design control. And all this bureaucracy that people in tech would just lose their minds at design control basically means you have to round trip everything through Silver Spring, Maryland, which is where the FDA is to make significant modifications to your device. Now, of course, the FDA has never shipped anything of the complexity of an Apple Watch, if they're being put in a supervisory role, or something they don't understand. And, you know, seeing the medical apps, they blocked a bunch of medical apps and whatnot. So they also thought personal genomics, that's the reason that we don't have a billion personal genomes. Now, his entire industry was tacked, you know, two and three in music, or they couldn't give any recommendations and kind of new to the whole service, the near the whole service. So these are just some of the things that are in diagnostics. And so had, you know, in the alternate universe, where we had diagnostic grid wearables, where we had personal genomes, where we had fast tests, where we had at home tests, this would be a much less serious thing, because we have knowledge about it, you wouldn't have to have everybody at home, because you would know where the green zones and the red zones were, you know, the green and red people at least to a greater degree of confidence, right? I'm not saying it's the only factor, but it's a major, major factor for sure. I mean, they have

Unknown Speaker  1:48:22  
they have that they have that thermometer, that tests and then uploads it to the cloud, and they're starting to get an idea of where the things are breaking out already, those should just be standard issue we should make as part of the surplus, give every person a connected thermometer for free. And just that's exactly right, the damn temperature.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:38  
And so the FDA helped cause this, and, and they're, they're continuing to, by the way, you know, they're under finally pressure to, to approve drugs, and, and to ship devices, like they got the Abbott Labs kind of thing out there, but they have a lot of things good. It's just, it's just not at the scale that is necessary at home testing is going to be part of it. Anyway, I think we're going to need to decentralize the FDA as well, where you go to there's a lot of pathways, by the way outside the FDA that people don't know about, on like CLIA like compounding pharmacies like right to try, like other countries, like, like MDS can prescribe off label. So there's, there's paths around them in different ways. And I think we're going to need to systematize that, and allow Governor's at the state level, to set up alternate regulatory pathways that take all these other things and kind of put them under one umbrella, expanded right to try. And the idea is you still have a regulator, but it's the local state regulators, let's say California State in collaboration with Stanford, he signs off on something,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:33  
yeah, we can be much more aggressive because we know what we're doing. And we want to take that risk for the reward back to the risk reward if you want to go to the moon, like somebody's got to put themselves on a tip of a giant bucket of kerosene and see what happens.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:47  
Exactly. And so I think what we get are, let's say 10, different parallel regulatory regimes. It's, let's say, you know, the West Coast or California has northeast California. Northeast has Harvard, you know, Minnesota area has the Mayo Clinic, um, you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:03  
right, the centralized, you get a couple of different experiments going you see which one produces the best results.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:09  
Exactly. And now once you've got that, once you have even a relatively small amount of competition, some of those regions will stake their their way out as being the most entrepreneur friendly. And with the, you know, like most risk tolerant, and others will take a more conservative approach. And and so now you can actually have some some degree of intelligence in the system where there's, there's, frankly, a control, right people talk about, you know, RCTs randomized control trials for everything other than regulation itself.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:39  
Anyway, we got to wrap. We did two hours. I knew we would. This is incredible. Thanks for doing it. I'm gonna have you back on the pod in a couple of weeks, I think because we're gonna need an update in 30 days from you, everybody follow our lodgy he's Ba La JI s. Thanks for coming again, and be safe, my friend. You too, sir. Okay, talk to you soon. Have a great night. And thank you to all the frontline workers. And I mean, everybody on the frontline, whether you're a janitor, cleaning up at a hospital, a nurse, an ambulance driver, instacart, Uber Eats grubhub Uber drivers, bus drivers, anybody who's keeping those essential services going, we are in awe of you and the sacrifice and the risk you're taking. You're no different than those soldiers on the front lines, as far as I'm concerned as far as we're concerned. And we're in our view. And if you are listening to my voice, and you are a part of a privileged class that can listen to a podcast like this, like in startups, you can give a 10 or 20 or 30 or 50 or $100 tip. Go ahead and start tipping those workers if they're not going to actually tips from Jeff Bezos and Amazon. Please, Jeff, if you hear my voice, can you put tipping in Amazon Prime when that'd be great Balaji if I could just set a tip for Amazon Prime delivers of giving them 10 bucks or 20 bucks every time they bring me a box.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:54  
Oh, these folks, these folks should get hazard pay base.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:57  
pay double pay. It's a no brainer. Yep, double their pay. We're also going to strike and then we got chaos. Okay, we'll see you on next time. Bye bye.
